The A-B-Z of Cheese
-----------------------------------------------

*Each cheese is listed by its name and country of
origin, with any further information available. Unless otherwise
indicated, the cheese is made of cow's milk.*

### **A**

**Aberdeen**
*Scotland*

Soft; creamy mellow.

**Abertam**
   *Bohemia* *(Made near Carlsbad*)

Hard; sheep; distinctive, with a savory smack all its
own.

**Absinthe** *see* Petafina.

**Acidophilus** *see* Saint-Ivel.

**Aettekees**
*Belgium*

November to May—winter-made and eaten.

**Affiné, Carré** *see* Ancien Impérial.

**Affumicata, Mozzarella** *see* Mozzarella.

**After-dinner cheeses** *see* [Chapter
8](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_111).

**Agricultural school cheeses** *see*
College-educated.

**Aiguilles, Fromage d'**
*Alpine France*

Named "Cheese of the Needles" from the sharp Alpine
peaks of the district where it is made.

**Aizy, Cendrée d'** *see* Cendrée.

**Ajacilo, Ajaccio**
*Corsica*

Semihard; piquant; nut-flavor. Named after the chief
city of French Corsica where a cheese-lover, Napoleon, was born.

**à la Crème** *see* Fromage, Fromage Blanc,
Chevretons.

**à la Main** *see* Vacherin.

**à la Pie** *see* Fromage.

**à la Rachette** *see* Bagnes.

**Albini**
*Northern Italy*

Semihard; made of both goat and cow milk; white,
mellow, pleasant-tasting table cheese.

**Albula**
*Switzerland*

Rich with the flavor of cuds of green herbs chewed into
creamy milk that makes tasty curds. Made in the fertile Swiss Valley of
Albula whose proud name it bears.

**Alderney**
*Channel Islands*

The French, who are fond of this special product of the
very special breed of cattle named after the Channel Island of Alderney,
translate it phonetically—Fromage d'Aurigny.

**Alemtejo**
*Portugal*

Called in full Queijo de Alemtejo, cheese of Alemtejo,
in the same way that so many French cheeses carry along the *fromage*
title. Soft; sheep and sometimes goat or cow; in cylinders of three
sizes, weighing respectively about two ounces, one pound, and four
pounds. The smaller sizes are the ones most often made with mixed goat
and sheep milk. The method of curdling without the usual animal rennet
is interesting and unusual. The milk is warmed and curdled with
vegetable rennet made from the flowers of a local thistle, or cardoon,
which is used in two other Portuguese cheeses—Queijo da Cardiga and
Queijo da Serra da Estrella—and probably in many others not known beyond
their locale. In France la Caillebotte is distinguished for being
clabbered with *chardonnette*, wild artichoke seed. In Portugal, where
there isn't so much separating of the sheep from the goats, it takes
several weeks for Alemtejos to ripen, depending on the lactic content
and difference in sizes.

**Alfalfa** *see* Sage.

**Alise Saint-Reine**
*France*

Soft; summer-made.

**Allgäuer Bergkäse, Allgäuer Rundkäse, or Allgäuer
Emmentaler**
*Bavaria*

Hard; Emmentaler type. The small district of Allgäu
names a mountain of cheeses almost as fabulous as our "Rock-candy
Mountain." There are two principal kinds, vintage Allgäuer Bergkäse and
soft Allgäuer Rahmkäse, described below. This celebrated cheese section
runs through rich pasture lands right down and into the Swiss Valley of
the Emme that gives the name Emmentaler to one of the world's greatest.
So it is no wonder that Allgäuer Bergkäse can compete with the best
Swiss. Before the Russian revolution, in fact, all vintage cheeses of
Allgäu were bought up by wealthy Russian noblemen and kept in their home
caves in separate compartments for each year, as far back as the early
1900's. As with fine vintage wines, the price of the great years went up
steadily. Such cheeses were shipped to their Russian owners only when
the chief cheese-pluggers of Allgäu found they had reached their
prime.

**Allgäuer Rahmkäse**
*Bavaria*

Full cream, similar to Romadur and Limburger, but
milder than both. This sets a high grade for similar cheeses made in the
Bavarian mountains, in monasteries such as Andechs. It goes exquisitely
with the rich dark Bavarian beer. Some of it is as slippery as the
stronger, smellier Bierkäse, or the old-time Slipcote of England. Like
so many North Europeans, it is often flavored with caraway. Although
entirely different from its big brother, vintage Bergkäse, Rahmkäse can
stand proudly at its side as one of the finest cheeses in
Germany.

**Alpe** *see* Fiore di Alpe.

**Al Pepe**
*Italy*

Hard and peppery, like its name. Similar to Pepato
(*see*).

**Alpes**
*France*

Similar to Bel Paese.

**Alpestra**
*Austria*

A smoked cheese that tastes, smells and inhales like
whatever fish it was smoked with. The French Alps has a different
Alpestre; Italy spells hers Alpestro.

**Alpestre, Alpin, or Fromage de Briançon**
*France*

Hard; goat; dry; small; lightly salted. Made at
Briançon and Gap.

**Alpestro**
*Italy*

Semisoft; goat; dry; lightly salted.

**Alpin or Clérimbert**
*Alpine France*

The milk is coagulated with rennet at 80° F. in two
hours. The curd is dipped into molds three to four inches in diameter
and two and a half inches in height, allowed to drain, turned several
times for one day only, then salted and ripened one to two weeks.

**Altenburg, or Altenburger Ziegenkäse**
*Germany*

Soft; goat; small and flat—one to two inches thick,
eight inches in diameter, weight two pounds.

**Alt Kuhkäse Old Cow Cheese**
*Germany*

Hard; well-aged, as its simple name suggests.

**Altsohl** *see* Brinza.

**Ambert, or Fourme d'Ambert**
*Limagne, Auvergne, France*

A kind of Cheddar made from November to May and
belonging to the Cantal—Fourme-La Tome tribe.

**American, American Cheddar**
*U.S.A.*

Described under their home states and distinctive names
are a dozen fine American Cheddars, such as Coon, Wiscon sin, Herkimer
County and Tillamook, to name only a few. They come in as many different
shapes, with traditional names such as Daisies, Flats, Longhorns,
Midgets, Picnics, Prints and Twins. The ones simply called Cheddars
weigh about sixty pounds. All are made and pressed and ripened in about
the same way, although they differ greatly in flavor and quality. They
are ripened anywhere from two months to two years and become sharper,
richer and more flavorsome, as well as more expensive, with the passing
of time. *See* Cheddar states and Cheddar types in [Chapter
4](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_37).

**Americano Romano**
*U.S.A.*

Hard; brittle; sharp.

**Amou**
*Béarn, France*

Winter cheese, October to May.

**Anatolian**
*Turkey*

Hard; sharp.

**Anchovy Links**
*U.S.A.*

American processed cheese that can be mixed up with
anchovies or any fish from whitebait to whale, made like a sausage and
sold in handy links.

**Ancien Impérial**
*Normandy, France*

Soft; fresh cream; white, mellow and creamy like
Neufchâtel and made in the same way. Tiny bricks packaged in tin foil,
two inches square, one-half inch thick, weighing three ounces. Eaten
both fresh and when ripe. It is also called Carré and has separate names
for the new and the old: (a) Petit Carré when newly made; (b) Carré
Affiné, when it has reached a ripe old age, which doesn't take
long—about the same time as Neufchâtel.

**Ancona** *see* Pecorino.

**Andean**
*Venezuela*

A cow's-milker made in the Andes near Mérida. It is
formed into rough cubes and wrapped in the pungent, aromatic leaves of
*Frailejón Lanudo* (*Espeletia Schultzii*) which imparts to it a
characteristic flavor. (Description given in *Buen Provecho!* by Dorothy
Kamen-Kaye.)

**Andechs**
*Bavaria*

A lusty Allgäuer type. Monk-made on the monastery hill
at Andechs on Ammersee. A superb snack with equally monkish dark beer,
black bread and blacker radishes, served by the brothers in dark brown
robes.

**Antwerp**
*Belgium*

Semihard; nut-flavored; named after its place of
origin.

**Appenzeller**
*Switzerland, Bavaria and Baden*

Semisoft Emmentaler type made in a small twenty-pound
wheel—a pony-cart wheel in comparison to the big Swiss. There are two
qualities: (a) Common, made of skim milk and cured in brine for a year;
(b) Festive, full milk, steeped in brine with wine, plus white wine lees
and pepper. The only cheese we know of that is ripened with lees of
wine.

**Appetitost**
*Denmark*

Semisoft; sour milk; nutlike flavor. It's an appetizer
that lives up to its name, eaten fresh on the spot, from the loose
bottom pans in which it is made.

**Appetost**
*Denmark*

Sour buttermilk, similar to Primula, with caraway seeds
added for snap. Imitated in U.S.A.

**Apple** *U.S.A.*

A small New York State Cheddar put up in the form of a
red-cheeked apple for New York City trade. Inspired by the pear-shaped
Provolone and Baby Gouda, no doubt.

**Arber**
*Bohemia*

Semihard; sour milk; yellow; mellow and creamy. Made in
mountains between Bohemia and Silesia.

**Argentine**
*Argentina*

Argentina is specially noted for fine reproductions of
classical Italian hard-grating cheeses such as Parmesan and Romano, rich
and fruity because of the lush pampas-grass feeding.

**Armavir**
*Western Caucasus*

Soft; whole sour sheep milk; a hand cheese made by
stirring cold, sour buttermilk or whey into heated milk, pressing in
forms and ripening in a warm place. Similar to Hand cheese.

**Arnauten** *see* Travnik.

**Arovature**
*Italy*

Water-buffalo milk.

**Arras, Coeurs d'** *see* Coeurs.

**Arrigny**
*Champagne, France*

Made only in winter, November to May. Since gourmet
products of the same province often have a special affinity, Arrigny and
champagne are specially well suited to one another.

**Artichoke, Cardoon or Thistle for Rennet** *see*
Caillebotte.

**Artificial Dessert Cheese**

In the lavish days of olde England Artificial Dessert
Cheese was made by mixing one quart of cream with two of milk and
spiking it with powdered cinnamon, nutmeg and mace. Four beaten eggs
were then stirred in with one-half cup of white vinegar and the mixture
boiled to a curd. It was then poured into a cheesecloth and hung up to
drain six to eight hours. When taken out of the cloth it was further
flavored with rose water, sweetened with castor sugar, left to ripen for
an hour or two and finally served up with more cream.

**Asadero, or Oaxaca**
*Jalisco and Oaxaca, Mexico*

White; whole-milk. Curd is heated, and hot curd is cut
and braided or kneaded into loaves from eight ounces to eleven pounds in
weight Asadero means "suitable for roasting."

**Asco**
*Corsica, France*

Made only in the winter season, October to May.

**Asiago I, II and III**
*Vicenza, Italy*

Sometimes classed as medium and mild, depending mostly
on age. Loaves weigh about eighteen pounds each and look like American
Cheddar but have a taste all their own.

I. Mild, nutty and sharp, used for table slicing and
eating.

II. Medium, semihard and tangy, also used for slicing
until nine months old.

III. Hard, old, dry, sharp, brittle. When over nine
months old, it's fine for grating.

**Asin, or Water cheese**
*Northern Italy*

Sour-milk; washed-curd; whitish; soft; buttery. Made
mostly in spring and eaten in summer and autumn. Dessert cheese,
frequently eaten with honey and fruit.

**Au Cumin**
*see* Münster.

**Au Fenouil**
*see* Tome de Savoie.

**Australian and New Zealand**
*Australia and New Zealand*

Enough cheese is produced for local consumption,
chiefly Cheddar; some Gruyère, but unfortunately mostly
processed.

**Autun**
*Nivernais, France*

Produced and eaten all year. Fromage de Vache is
another name for it and this is of special interest in a province where
the chief competitors are made of goat's milk.

**Auvergne, Bleu d'** *see* Bleu.

**Au Vin Blanc, Confits** *see* Epoisses.

**Avesnes, Boulette d'** *see* Boulette.

**Aydes, les**
*Orléanais, France*

Not eaten during July, August or September. Season,
October to June.

**Azeitão, Queijo do**
*Portugal*

Soft, sheep, sapid and extremely oily as the
superlative *ão* implies. There are no finer, fatter cheeses in the
world than those made of rich sheep milk in the mountains of Portugal
and named for them.

**Azeitoso**
*Portugal*

Soft; mellow, zestful and as oily as it is
named.

**Azuldoch Mountain**
*Turkey*

Mild and mellow mountain product.

### **B**

**Backsteiner**
*Bavaria*

Resembles Limburger, but smaller, and translates Brick,
from the shape. It is aromatic and piquant and not very much like the
U.S. Brick.

**Bagnes, or Fromage à la Raclette**
*Switzerland*

Not only hard but very hard, named from *racler*,
French for "scrape." A thick, one-half-inch slice is cut across the
whole cheese and toasted until runny. It is then scraped off the pan
it's toasted in with a flexible knife, spread on bread and eaten like an
open-faced Welsh Rabbit sandwich.

**Bagozzo, Grana Bagozzo, Bresciano**
*Italy*

Hard; yellow; sharp. Surface often colored red.
Parmesan type.

**Bakers' cheese**

Skim milk, similar to cottage cheese, but softer and
finer grained. Used in making bakery products such as cheese cake, pie,

Made from thick sour milk in Pennsylvania in the style
of the original Pennsylvania Dutch settlers.

**Ballakäse or Womelsdorf**

Similar to Ball.

**Balls, Dutch Red**

English name for Edam.

**Banbury**
*England*

Soft, rich cylinder about one inch thick made in the
town of Banbury, famous for its spicy, citrus-peel buns and its
equestrienne. Banbury cheese with Banbury buns made a sensational snack
in the early nineteenth century, but both are getting scarce
today.

**Banick**
*Armenia*

White and sweet.

**Banjaluka**
*Bosnia*

Port-Salut type from its Trappist monastery.

**Banon, or les Petits Banons**
*Provence, France,*

Small, dried, sheep-milker, made in the foothills of
the Alps and exported through Marseilles in season, May to November.
This sprightly summer cheese is generously sprinkled with the local
brandy and festively wrapped in fresh green leaves.

**Bar cheese**
*U.S.A.*

Any saloon Cheddar, formerly served on every free-lunch
counter in the U.S. Before Prohibition, free-lunch cheese was the
backbone of America's cheese industry.

**Barbacena**
*Minas Geraes, Brazil*

Hard, white, sometimes chalky. Named from its home city
in the leading cheese state of Brazil.

**Barberey, or Fromage de Troyes**
*Champagne, France*

Soft, creamy and smooth, resembling Camembert, five to
six inches in diameter and 1¼ inches thick. Named from its home town,
Barberey, near Troyes, whose name it also bears. Fresh, warm milk is
coagulated by rennet in four hours. Uncut curd then goes into a wooden
mold with a perforated bottom, to drain three hours, before being
finished off in an earthenware mold. The cheeses are salted, dried and
ripened three weeks in a cave. The season is from November to May and
when made in summer they are often sold fresh.

**Barboux**
*France*

Soft.

**Baronet**
*U.S.A.*

A natural product, mild and mellow.

**Barron**
*France*

Soft.

**Bassillac** *see* Bleu.

**Bath**
*England*

Gently made, lightly salted, drained on a straw mat in
the historic resort town of Bath. Ripened in two weeks and eaten only
when covered with a refined fuzzy mold that's also eminently edible. It
is the most delicate of English-speaking cheeses.

**Battelmatt**
*Switzerland, St. Gothard Alps, northern Italy, and western
Austria*

An Emmentaler made small where milk is not plentiful.
The "wheel" is only sixteen inches in diameter and four inches high,
weighing forty to eighty pounds. The cooking of the curd is done at a
little lower temperature than Emmentaler, it ripens more rapidly—in four
months — and is somewhat softer, but has the same holes and creamy
though sharp, full nutty flavor.

**Bauden** (*see also* Koppen)
*Germany, Austria, Bohemia and Silesia*

Semisoft, sour milk, hand type, made in herders'
mountain huts in about the same way as Harzkäse, though it is bigger. In
two forms, one cup shape (called Koppen), the other a cylinder. Strong
and aromatic, whether made with or without caraway.

**Bavarian Beer cheese** *see* Bayrischer
Bierkäse.

**Bavarian Cream**
*German*

Bavarois.

**Bayonne** *see* Fromage de Bayonne.

*Bavaria*

Bavarian beer cheese from the Tyrol is made not only to
eat with beer, but to dunk in it.

**Beads of cheese**
*Tibet*

strung like a necklace of cowrie shells or a rosary, fifty to a hundred
on a string. *Also see* Money Made of Cheese.

**Beagues** *see* Tome de Savoie.

**Bean Cake, Tao-foo, or Tofu**
*China, Japan, the Orient*

oriental ports, and also imitated in every Chinatown around the world.
Made from the milk of beans and curdled with its own vegetable
rennet.

**Beaujolais** *see* Chevretons.

**Beaumont, or Tome de Beaumont**
*Savoy, France*

A more or less successful imitation of Trappist Tamie,
a trade-secret triumph of Savoy. At its best from October to
June.

**Beaupré de Roybon**
*Dauphiné, France*

A winter specialty made from November to April.

**Beckenried**
*Switzerland*

A good mountain cheese from goat milk.

**Beer cheese**
*U.S.A.*

While our beer cheese came from Germany and the word is
merely a translation of Bierkäse, we use it chiefly for a type of strong
Limburger made mostly in Milwaukee. This fine, aromatic cheese is
considered by many as the very best to eat while drinking beer. But in
Germany Bierkäse is more apt to be dissolved in a glass or stein of
beer, much as we mix malted powder in milk, and drunk with it, rather
than eaten.

**Beer-Regis**
*Dorsetshire, England*

This sounds like another beer cheese, but it's only a
mild Cheddar named after its hometown in Dorsetshire.

**Beist-Cheese**
*Scotland*

A curiosity of the old days. "The first milk after a
calving, boiled or baked to a thick consistency, the result somewhat
resembling new-made cheese, though this is clearly not a true cheese."
(MacNeill)

**Belarno**
*Italy*

Hard; goat; creamy dessert cheese.

**Belgian Cooked**
*Belgium*

The milk, which has been allowed to curdle
spontaneously, is skimmed and allowed to drain. When dry it is
thoroughly kneaded by hand and is allowed to undergo fermentation, which
takes ordinarily from ten to fourteen days in winter and six to eight
days in summer. When the fermentation is complete, cream and salt are
added and the mixture is heated slowly and stirred until homogeneous,
when it is put into molds and allowed to ripen for eight days longer. A
cheese ordinarily weighs about three-and-a-half pounds. It is not
essentially different from other forms of cooked cheese.

**Beli Sir** *see* Domaci.

**Bellelay, Tête de Moine, or Monk's Head**
*Switzerland*

Soft, buttery, semisharp spread. Sweet milk is
coagulated with rennet in twenty to thirty minutes, the curd cut fairly
fine and cooked not so firm as Emmentaler, but firmer than Limburger.
After being pressed, the cheeses are wrapped in bark for a couple of
weeks until they can stand alone. Since no eyes are desired in the
cheeses, they are ripened in a moist cellar at a lowish temperature.
They take a year to ripen and will keep three or four years. The
diameter is seven inches, the weight nine to fifteen pounds. The monk's
head after cutting is kept wrapped in a napkin soaked in white wine and
the soft, creamy spread is scraped out to "butter" bread and snacks that
go with more white wine. Such combinations of old wine and old cheese
suggest monkish influence, which began here in the fifteenth century
with the jolly friars of the Canton of Bern. There it is still made
exclusively and not exported, for there's never quite enough to go
around.

**Bel Paese**
*Italy*

*See under* [Foreign Greats, Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).
*Also see* Mel Fino, a blend, and Bel Paese types—French Boudanne and
German Saint Stefano. The American imitation is not nearly so good as
the Italian original.

**Bel Paesino**
*U.S.A.*

A play on the Bel Paese name and fame. Weight one pound
and diminutive in every other way.

**Bergkäse** *see* Allgäuer.

**Bergquara**
*Sweden*

Semihard, fat, resembles Dutch Gouda. Tangy, pleasant
taste. Gets sharper with age, as they all do. Molded in cylinders of
fifteen to forty pounds. Popular in Sweden since the eighteenth
century.

**Berkeley**
*England*

Named after its home town in Gloucester,
England.

**Berliner Kuhkäse**
*Berlin, Germany*

Cow cheese, pet-named turkey cock cheese by Berlin
students. Typical German hand cheese, soft; aromatic with caraway seeds,
and that's about the only difference between it and Alt Kuhkäse, without
caraway.

**Bernarde, Formagelle Bernarde**
*Italy*

Cow's whole milk, to which about 10% of goat's milk is
added for flavor. Cured for two months.

Brittle; blue-veined; smooth; biting.

**Bleu d'Auvergne or Fromage Bleu**
*Auvergne, France*

Hard; sheep or mixed sheep, goat or cow; from
Pontgibaud and Laqueuille ripening caves. Similar to better-known Cantal
of the same province. Akin to Roquefort and Stilton, and to Bleu de
Laqueuille.

*Limousin, France*

Blue mold of Roquefort type that's prime from November
to May.

*Lower Limousin*

Practically the same as Bleu de Bassillac, from Lower
Limousin.

A process product.

**Blue Vinny, Blue Vinid, Blue-veined Dorset, or Double
Dorset**
*Dorsetshire, England*

A unique Blue that actually isn't green-veined. Farmers
make it for private consumption, because it dries up too easily to
market. An epicurean esoteric match for Truckles No. 1 of Wiltshire. It
comes in a flat form, chalk-white, crumbly and sharply flavored, with a
"royal Blue" vein running right through horizontally. The Vinny mold,
from which it was named, is different from all other cheese molds and
has a different action.

**Bocconi Geganti**
*Italy*

Sharp and smoky specialty.

**Bocconi Provoloni** *see* Provolone.

I. Also known as Schachtelkäse, Boxed Cheese; and
Hohenheim, where it is made. A rather unimportant variety. Made in a
copper kettle, with partially skim milk, colored with saffron and spiked
with caraway, a handful to every two hundred pounds. Salted and ripened
for three months and shipped in wooden boxes.

II. Also known by names of localities where made:
Hohenburg, Mondess and Weihenstephan. Made of whole milk. Mild but
piquant.

**Bra No. I**
*Piedmont, Italy*

Hard, round form, twelve inches in diameter, three
inches high, weight twelve pounds. A somewhat romantic cheese, made by
nomads who wander with their herds from pasture to pasture in the region
of Bra.

**Bra No. II**
*Turin and Cuneo, Italy*

Soft, creamy, small, round and mild although cured in
brine.

**Brand or Brandkäse**
*Germany*

Soft, sour-milk hand cheese, weighing one-third of a
pound. The curd is cooked at a high temperature, then salted and set to
ferment for a day. Butter is then mixed into it before pressing into
small bricks. After drying it is put in used beer kegs to ripen and is
frequently moistened with beer while curing.

**Brandy** *see* Caledonian, Cream.

**Branja de Brailia**
*Rumania*

Hard; sheep; extra salty because always kept in
brine.

**Branja de Cosulet**
*Rumania*

Described by Richard Wyndham in *Wine and Food*
(Winter, 1937): A creamy sheep's cheese which is encased in pine bark.
My only criticism of this most excellent cheese is that the center must
always remain a gastronomical second best. It is no more interesting
than a good English Cheddar, while the outer crust has a scented,
resinous flavor which must be unique among cheeses.

**Bratkäse**
*Switzerland*

Strong; specially made to roast in slices over coal.
Fine, grilled on toast.

**Breakfast, Frühstück, Lunch, Delikat, and other
names**
*Germany*

Soft and delicate, but with a strong tang. Small round,
for spreading. Lauterbach is a well-known breakfast cheese in Germany,
while in Switzerland Emmentaler is eaten at all three meals.

**Breakstone**
*U.S.A.*

Like Borden and other leading American cheesemongers
and manufacturers, Breakstone offer a full line, of which their cream
cheese is an American product to be proud of.

**Brésegaut**
*Savoy, France*

Soft, white.

**Breslau**
*Germany*

A proud Prussian dessert cheese.

**Bressans** *see* les Petits.

**Bresse**
*France*

Lightly cooked.

**Bretagne** *see* Montauban.

**Brevine**
*Switzerland*

Emmentaler type.

**Briançon** *see* Alpin.

**Brick** *see* [Chapter
4](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_37).

**Brickbat**
*Wiltshire, England*

A traditional Wiltshire product since early in the
eighteenth century. Made with fresh milk and some cream, to ripen for
one year before "it's fit to eat." The French call it Briqueton.

**Bricotta**
*Corsica*

Semisoft, sour sheep, sometimes mixed with sugar and
rum and made into small luscious cakes.

**Brie** *see* [Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17);
*also see* Cendré and Coulommiers.

**Brie Façon**
*France*

The name of imitation Brie or Brie type made in all
parts of France. Often it is dry, chalky, and far inferior to the finest
Brie *véritable* that is still made best in its original home, formerly
called La Brie, now Seine et Marne, or Ile-de-France.

*see* Nivernais Decize, Le Mont d'Or, and
Ile-de-France.

**Brie de Meaux**
*France*

This genuine Brie from the Meaux region has an
excellent reputation for high quality. It is made only from November to
May.

**Brie de Melun**
*France*

This Brie *véritable* is made not only in the seasonal
months, from November to May, but practically all the year around. It is
not always prime. Summer Brie, called Maigre, is notably poor and thin.
Spring Brie is merely Migras, half-fat, as against the fat autumn Gras
that ripens until May.

**Brillat-Savarin**
*Normandy, France*

Soft, and available all year. Although the author of
*Physiologie du Goût* was not noted as a caseophile and wrote little on
the subject beyond *Le Fondue* (*see* [Chapter
6](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_84)),
this savory Normandy produce is named in his everlasting praise.

**Brina Dubreala**
*Rumania*

Semisoft, sheep, done in brine.

**Brindza**
*U.S.A.*

Our imitation of this creamy sort of fresh, white
Roquefort is as popular in foreign colonies in America as back in its
Hungarian and Greek homelands. On New York's East Side several stores
advertise "Brindza fresh daily," with an extra "d" crowded into the
original Brinza.

**Brine** *see* Italian Bra, Caucasian Ekiwani, Brina
Dubreala, Briney.

**Briney, or Brined**
*Syria*

Semisoft, salty, sharp. So-called from being processed
in brine. Turkish Tullum Penney is of the same salt-soaked type.

**Brinza, or Brinsen**
*Hungary, Rumania, Carpathian Mountains*

Goes by many local names: Altsohl, Klencz, Landoch,
Liptauer, Neusohl, Siebenburgen and Zips. Soft, sheep milk or sheep and
goat; crumbly, sharp and biting, but creamy. Made in small lots and
cured in a tub with beech shavings. Ftinoporino is its opposite number
in Macedonia.

**Brioler** *see* Westphalia.

**Briquebec** *see* Providence

**Briqueton**
*England*

The French name for English Wiltshire Brickbat, one of
the very few cheeses imported into France. Known in France in the
eighteenth century, it may have influenced the making of Trappist
Port-Salut at the Bricquebec Monastery in Manche.

**Brittle** *see* Greek Cashera, Italian Ricotta,
Turkish Rarush Durmar, and U.S. Hopi.

**Brizecon**
*Savoy, France*

Imitation Reblochon made in the same Savoy
province.

**Broccio, or le Brocconis**
*Corsica, France*

Soft, sour sheep milk or goat, like Bricotta and a
first cousin to Italian Chiavari. Cream white, slightly salty; eaten
fresh in Paris, where it is as popular as on its home island. Sometimes
salted and half-dried, or made into little cakes with rum and sugar.
Made and eaten all year.

**Broodkaas**
*Holland*

Hard, flat, nutty.

**Brousses de la Vézubie, les**
*Nice, France*

Small; sheep; long narrow bar shape, served either with
powdered sugar or salt, pepper and chopped chives. Made in
Vézubie.

**Brussels or Bruxelles**
*Belgium*

Soft, washed skim milk, fermented, semisharp, from
Louvain and Hal districts.

**Budapest**
*Hungary*

Soft, fresh, creamy and mellow, a favorite at home in
Budapest and abroad in Vienna.

**Buderich**
*Germany*

A specialty in Dusseldorf.

**Bulle**
*Switzerland*

A Swiss-Gruyère.

**Bundost**
*Sweden*

Semihard; mellow; tangy.

**Burgundy**
*France*

Named after the province, not the wine, but they go
wonderfully together.

**Bushman**
*Australia*

Semihard; yellow; tangy.

**Butter and Cheese** *see* [Chapter
8](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_111).

**"Butter," Serbian** *see* Kajmar.

**Buttermilk**
*U.S. & Europe*

Resembles cottage cheese, but of finer grain.

### **C**

**Cabeçou, le**
*Auvergne, France*

Small; goat; from Maurs.

**Cabrillon**
*Auvergne, France*

So much like the Cabreçon they might be called sister
nannies under the rind.

**Cachet d'Entrechaux, le, or Fromage Fort du
Ventoux**

*Provence Mountains, France*

Semihard; sheep; mixed with brandy, dry white wine and
sundry seasonings. Well marinated and extremely strong. Season May to
November.

**Caciocavallo**
*Italy*

"Horse Cheese." The ubiquitous cheese of classical
greats, imitated all around the world and back to Italy again. *See*
[Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).

**Caciocavallo Siciliano**
*Sicily, also in U.S.A.*

Essentially a pressed Provolone. Usually from cow's
whole milk, but sometimes from goat's milk or a mixture of the two.
Weight between 17½ and 26 pounds. Used for both table cheese and
grating.

**Cacio Fiore, or Caciotta**
*Italy*

Soft as butter; sheep; in four-pound square frames;
sweetish; eaten fresh.

**Cacio Pecorino Romano** *see* Pecorino.

**Cacio Romano** *see* Chiavari.

**Caerphilly**
*Wales and England—Devon, Dorset, Somerset & Wilshire*

Semihard; whole fresh milk; takes three weeks to ripen.
Also sold "green," young and innocent, at the age of ten to eleven days
when weighing about that many pounds. Since it has little keeping
qualities it should be eaten quickly. Welsh miners eat a lot of it,
think it specially suited to their needs, because it is easily digested
and does not produce so much heat in the body as long-keeping
cheeses.

**Caillebottes (Curds)**
*France—Anjou, Poitou, Saintonge & Vendée*

Soft, creamy, sweetened fresh or sour milk clabbered
with chardonnette, wild artichoke seed, over slow fire. Cut in lozenges
and served cold not two hours after cooking. Smooth, mellow and
aromatic. A high type of this unusual cheese is Jonchée (*see*). Other
cheeses are made with vegetable rennet, some from similar thistle or
cardoon juice, especially in Portugal.

**Caille de Poitiers** *see* Petits pots.

**Caille de Habas**
*Gascony, France*

Clabbered or clotted sheep milk.

**Cajassou**
*Périgord, France*

A notable goat cheese made in Cubjac.

**Calabrian**
*Italy*

The Calabrians make good sheep cheese, such as this and
Caciocavallo.

**Calcagno**
*Sicily*

Hard; ewe's milk. Suitable for grating.

**Caledonian Cream**
*Scotland*

More of a dessert than a true cheese. We read in
*Scotland's Inner Man*: "A sort of fresh cream cheese, flavored with
chopped orange marmalade, sugar brandy and lemon juice. It is whisked
for about half an hour. Otherwise, if put into a freezer, it would be
good ice-pudding."

**Calvados**
*France*

Medium-hard; tangy. Perfect with Calvados applejack
from the same province.

**Calvenzano**
*Italy*

Similar to Gorgonzola, made in Bergamo.

**Cambrai** *see* Boulette.

**Cambridge, or York**
*England*

Soft; fresh; creamy; tangy. The curd is quickly made in
one hour and dipped into molds without cutting to ripen for eating in
thirty hours.

**Camembert** *see* [Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).

**"Camembert"**
*Germany, U.S. & elsewhere*

A West German imitation that comes in a cute little
heart-shaped box which nevertheless doesn't make it any more like the
Camembert *véritable* of Normandy.

**Camosun**
*U.S.A.*

Semisoft; open-textured, resembling Monterey. Drained
curd is pressed in hoops, cheese is salted in brine for thirty hours,
then coated with paraffin and cured for one to three months in humid
room at 50° to 60° F.

**Canadian Club**
*see* Cheddar Club.

**Cancoillotte, Cancaillotte, Canquoillotte,
Quincoillotte, Cancoiade, Fromagère, Tempête and "Purée" de fromage tres
fort**
*Franche-Comté, France*

Soft; sour milk; sharp and aromatic; with added eggs
and butter and sometimes brandy or dry white wine. Sold in attractive
small molds and pots. Other sharp seasonings besides the brandy or wine
make this one of the strongest of French strong cheeses, similar to
Fromage Fort.

**Canestrato**
*Sicily, Italy*

Hard; mixed goat and sheep; yellow and strong. Takes
one year to mature and is very popular both in Sicily where it is made
to perfection and in Southern Colorado where it is imitated by and for
Italian settlers.

**Cantal, Fromage de Cantal, Auvergne or Auvergne Bleu;
also Fourme and La Tome.**
*Auvergne, France*

Semihard; smooth; mellow; a kind of Cheddar, lightly
colored lemon; yellow; strong, sharp taste but hardly any smell. Forty
to a hundred-twenty pound cylinders. The rich milk from highland
pastures is more or less skimmed and, being a very old variety, it is
still made most primitively. Cured six weeks or six months, and when
very old it's very hard and very sharp. A Cantal type is Laguiole or
Guiole.

**Capitanata**
*Italy*

Sheep.

**Caprian**
*Capri, Italy*

Made from milk of goats that still overrun the original
Goat Island, and tangy as a buck.

**Caprino (Little Goat)**
*Argentina*

Semihard; goat; sharp; table cheese.

**Caraway Loaf**
*U.S.A.*

This is just one imitation of dozens of German
caraway-seeded cheeses that roam the world. In Germany there is not only
Kümmel loaf cheese but a loaf of caraway-seeded bread to go with it.
Milwaukee has long made a good Kümmelkäse or hand cheese and it would
take more than the fingers on both hands to enumerate all of the
European originals, from Dutch Komynkaas through Danish King Christian
IX and Norwegian Kuminost, Italian Freisa, Pomeranian Rinnen and Belgian
Leyden, to Pennsylvania Pot.

**Cardiga, Queijo da**
*Portugal*

Hard; sheep; oily; mild flavor. Named from cardo,
cardoon in English, a kind of thistle used as a vegetable rennet in
making several other cheeses, such as French Caillebottes curdled with
chardonnette, wild artichoke seed. Only classical Greek sheep cheeses
like Casera can compare with the superb ones from the Portuguese
mountain districts. They are lusciously oily, but never rancidly
so.

**Carlsbad**
*Bohemia*

Semihard; sheep; white; slightly salted;
expensive.

**Carré Affiné**
*France*

Soft, delicate, in small square forms; similar to Petit
Carré and Ancien Impérial (*see*).

**Carré de l'Est**
*France*

Similar to Camembert, and imitated in the U.S.A.

**Cascaval Penir**
*Turkey*

Cacciocavallo imitation consumed at home.

**Caseralla**
*Greece*

Semisoft; sheep; mellow; creamy.

**Casere**
*Greece*

Hard; sheep; brittle; gray and greasy. But wonderful!
Sour-sweet tongue tickle. This classical though greasy Grecian is
imitated with goat milk instead of sheep in Southern California.

**Cashera**
*Armenia and Greece*

Hard; goat or cow's milk; brittle; sharp; nutty.
Similar to Casere and high in quality.

**Cashera**
*Turkey*

Semihard; sheep.

**Casher Penner** *see* Kasher.

**Cashkavallo**
*Syria*

Mellow but sharp imitation of the ubiquitous Italian
Cacciocavallo.

**Casigiolu, Panedda, Pera di vacca**
*Sardinia*

Plastic-curd cheese, made by the Caciocavallo
method.

**Caskcaval or Kaschcavallo** *see* Feta.

**Caspian**
*Caucasus*

Semihard. Sheep or cow, milked directly into
cone-shaped cloth bag to speed the making. Tastes tangy, sharp and
biting.

**Cassaro**
*Italy*

Locally consumed, seldom exported.

**Castelmagno**
*Italy*

Blue-mold, Gorgonzola type.

**Castelo Branco, White Castle**
*Portugal*

Semisoft; goat or goat and sheep; fermented. Similar to
Serra da Estrella (*see*).

**Castillon, or Fromage de Gascony**
*France*

Fresh cream cheese.

**Castle, Schlosskäse**
*North Austria*

Limburger type.

**Catanzaro**
*Italy*

Consumed locally, seldom exported.

**Cat's Head** *see* Katzenkopf.

**Celery**
*Norway*

Flavored mildly with celery seeds, instead of the usual
caraway.

**Cendrée, la**
*France—Orléanais, Blois & Aube*

Hard; sheep; round and flat. Other Cendrées are
Champenois or Ricey, Brie, d'Aizy and Olivet

**Cendré d'Aizy**
*Burgundy, France*

Available all year. *See* la Cendrée.

**Cendré de la Brie**
*Ile-de-France, France*

Fall and winter Brie cured under the ashes, season
September to May.

**Cendré Champenois or Cendré des Riceys**
*Aube & Marne, France*

Made and eaten from September to June, and ripened
under the ashes.

**Cendré Olivet** *see* Olivet.

**Cenis** *see* Mont Cenis.

**Certoso Stracchino**
*Italy, near Milan*

A variety of Stracchino named after the Carthusian
friars who have made it for donkey's years. It is milder and softer and
creamier than the Taleggio because it's made of cow instead of goat
milk, but it has less distinction for the same reason.

**Ceva**
*Italy*

Soft veteran of Roman times named from its town near
Turin.

**Chabichou**
*Poitou, France*

Soft; goat; fresh; sweet and tasty. A vintage cheese of
the months from April to December, since such cheeses don't last long
enough to be vintaged like wine by the year.

**Chaingy**
*Orléans, France*

Season September to June.

**Cham**
*Switzerland*

One of those eminent Emmentalers from Cham, the home
town of Mister Pfister (*see* Pfister).

**Chamois milk**

Aristotle said that the most savorous cheese came from
the chamois. This small goatlike antelope feeds on wild mountain herbs
not available to lumbering cows, less agile sheep or domesticated
mountain goats, so it gives, in small quantity but high quality, the
richest, most flavorsome of milk.

**Champenois or Fromage des Riceys**
*Aube & Marne, France*

Season from September to June. The same as Cendré
Champenois and des Riceys.

**Champoléon de Queyras**
*Hautes-Alpes, France*.

Hard; skim-milker.

**Chantelle**
*U.S.A.*

Natural Port du Salut type described as "zesty" by some
of the best purveyors of domestic cheeses. It has a sharp taste and
little odor, perhaps to fill the demand for a "married man's
Limburger."

**Chantilly** *see* Hablé.

**Chaource**
*Champagne, France*

Soft, nice to nibble with the bottled product of this
same high-living Champagne Province. A kind of Camembert.

**Chapelle**
*France*

Soft.

**Charmey Fine**
*Switzerland*

Gruyère type.

**Chaschol, or Chaschosis**
*Canton of Grisons, Switzerland*

Hard; skim; small wheels, eighteen to twenty-two inches
in diameter by three to four inches high, weight twenty-two to forty
pounds.

**Chasteaux** *see* Petits Fromages.

**Chateauroux** *see* Fromage de Chèvre.

**Chaumont**
*Champagne, France*

Season November to May.

**Chavignol** *see* Crottin.

**Chechaluk**
*Armenia*

Soft; pot; flaky; creamy.

**Cheddar** *see* [Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).

**Cheese bread**
*Russia and U.S.A.*

For centuries Russia has excelled in making a
salubrious cheese bread called Notruschki and the cheese that flavors it
is Tworog. (*See both*.) Only recently Schrafft's in New York put out a
yellow, soft and toothsome cheese bread that has become very popular for
toasting. It takes heat to bring out its full cheesy savor. Good when
overlaid with cheese butter of contrasting piquance, say one mixed with
Sapsago.

**Cheese butter**

Equal parts of creamed butter and finely grated or soft
cheese and mixtures thereof. The imported but still cheap green Sapsago
is not to be forgotten when mixing your own cheese butter.

**Cheese food**
*U.S.A.*

"Any mixtures of various lots of cheese and other
solids derived from milk with emulsifying agents, coloring matter,
seasonings, condiments, relishes and water, heated or not, into a
homogeneous mass." (A long and kind word for a homely, tasteless,
heterogeneous mess.) From an advertisement

**Cheshire and Cheshire imitations** *see* with Cheddar
in [Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).

**Cheshire-Stilton**
*England*

In making this combination of Cheshire and Stilton, the
blue mold peculiar to Stilton is introduced in the usual Cheshire
process by keeping out each day a little of the curd and mixing it with
that in which the mold is growing well. The result is the Cheshire in
size and shape and general characteristics but with the blue veins of
Stilton, making it really a Blue Cheddar. Another combination is
Yorkshire-Stilton, and quite as distinguished.

**Chester**
*England*

Another name for Cheshire, used in France where
formerly some was imported to make the visiting Britishers feel at
home.

**Chevalier**
*France*

Curds sweetened with sugar.

**Chevèlle**
*U.S.A.*

A processed Wisconsin.

**Chèvre** *see* Fromages.

**Chèvre de Chateauroux** *see* Fromages.

**Chèvre petit** *see* Petìts Fromages.

**Chèvre, Tome de** *see* Tome.

**Chevretin**
*Savoy, France*

Goat; small and square. Named after the mammy nanny, as
so many are.

**Chevrets, Ponta & St. Rémy**
*Bresse & Franche-Comté, France*

Dry and semi-dry; crumbly; goat; small squares; lightly
salted. Season December to April. Such small goat cheeses are named in
the plural in France.

**Chevretons du Beaujolais à la crème, les**
*Lyonnais, France*

Small goat-milkers served with cream. This is a fair
sample of the railroad names some French cheeses stagger under.

**Chevrotins**
*Savoy, France*

Soft, dried goat milk; white; small; tangy and
semi-tangy. Made and eaten from March to December.

**Chhana**
*Asia*

All we know is that this is made of the whole milk of
cows, soured, and it is not as unusual as the double "h" in its
name.

**Chiavari**
*Italy*

There are two different kinds named for the Chiavari
region, and both are hard:
I. Sour cow's milk, also known as Cacio Romano.
II. Sweet whole milker, similar to Corsican Broccio. Chiavari, the
historic little port between Genoa and Pisa, is more noted as the
birthplace of the barbaric "chivaree" razzing of newlyweds with
its raucous serenade of dishpans, sour-note bugling and such.


**Chives cream cheese**

Of the world's many fine fresh cheeses further
freshened with chives, there's Belgian Hervé and French Claqueret (with
onion added). (*See both*.) For our taste it's best when the chives are
added at home, as it's done in Germany, in person at the table or just
before.

**Christalinna**
*Canton Graubünden, Switzerland*

Hard; smooth; sharp; tangy.

**Christian IX**
*Denmark*

A distinguished spiced cheese.

**Ciclo**
*Italy*

Soft, small cream cheese.

**Cierp de Luchon**
*France*

Made from November to May in the Comté de Foix, where
it has the distinction of being the only local product worth listing
with France's three hundred notables.

**Citeaux**
*Burgundy, France*

Trappist Port-Salut.

**Clabber cheese**
*England*

Simply cottage cheese left in a cool place until it
grows soft and automatically changes its name from cottage to
clabber.

**Clairvaux**
*France*

Formerly made in a Benedictine monastery of that
name.

**Claqueret, le**
*Lyonnais, France*

Fresh cream whipped with chives, chopped fine with
onions. *See* Chives.

**Clérimbert** *see* Alpin.

**Cleves**
*France*

French imitation of the German imitation of a
Holland-Dutch original.

**Cloves** *see* Nagelkäse.

**Club, Potted Club, Snappy, Cold-pack and Comminuted
cheese**
*U.S.A. and Canada*

Probably McLaren's Imperial Club in pots was first to
be called club, but others credit club to the U.S. In any case McLaren's
was bought by an American company and is now all-American.

Today there are many clubs that may sound swanky but
taste very ordinary, if at all. They are made of finely ground aged,
sharp Cheddar mixed with condiments, liquors, olives, pimientos, etc.,
and mostly carry come-on names to make the customers think they are
getting something from Olde England or some aristocratic private club.
All are described as "tangy."

Originally butter went into the better clubs which were
sold in small porcelain jars, but in these process days they are wrapped
in smaller tin foil and wax-paper packets and called "snappy."

**Coeur à la Crème**
*Burgundy, France*

This becomes Fromage à la Crème II (*see*) when served
with sugar, and it is also called a heart of cream after being molded
into that romantic shape in a wicker or willow-twig basket.

**Coeurs d'Arras**
*Artois, France*

These hearts of Arras are soft, smooth, mellow,
caressingly rich with the cream of Arras.

**Coffee-flavored cheese**

Just as the Dutch captivated coffee lovers all over the
world with their coffee-flavored candies, Haagische Hopjes, so the
French with Jonchée cheese and Italians with Ricotta satisfy the
universal craving by putting coffee in for flavor.

**Coimbra**
*Portugal*

Goat or cow; semihard; firm; round; salty; sharp. Not
only one of those college-educated cheeses but a postgraduate one,
bearing the honored name of Portugal's ancient academic center.

**Colby**
*U.S.A.*

Similar to Cheddar, but of softer body and more open
texture. Contains more moisture, and doesn't keep as well as
Cheddar.

**College-educated**

Besides Coimbra several countries have cheeses brought
out by their colleges. Even Brazil has one in Minas Geraes and
Transylvania another called Kolos-Monostor, while our agricultural
colleges in every big cheese state from California through Ames in Iowa,
Madison in Wisconsin, all across the continent to Cornell in New York,
vie with one another in turning out diploma-ed American Cheddars and
such of high degree. It is largely to the agricultural colleges that we
owe the steady improvement in both quality and number of foreign
imitations since the University of Wisconsin broke the curds early in
this century by importing Swiss professors to teach the high art of
Emmentaler.

**Colwick** *see* Slipcote.

**Combe-air**
*France*

Small; similar to Italian Stracchino in everything but
size.

**Commission**
*Holland*

Hard; ball-shaped like Edam and resembling it except
being darker in color and packed in a ball weighing about twice as much,
around eight pounds. It is made in the province of North Holland and in
Friesland. It is often preferred to Edam for size and nutty
flavor.

**Compiègne**
*France*

Soft

**Comté** *see* Gruyère.

**Conches**
*France*

Emmentaler type.

**Condrieu, Rigotte de la**
*Rhone Valley below Lyons, France*

Semihard; goat; small; smooth; creamy; mellow; tasty. A
cheese of cheeses for epicures, only made from May to November when
pasturage is rich.

**Confits au Marc de Bourgogne** *see* Epoisses.

**Confits au Vin Blanc** *see* Epoisses.

**Cooked, or Pennsylvania pot**
*U.S.A.*

Named from cooking sour clabbered curd to the melting
point. When cool it is allowed to stand three or four days until it is
colored through. Then it is cooked again with salt, milk, and usually
caraway. It is stirred until it's as thick as molasses and strings from
a spoon. It is then put into pots or molds, whose shape it retains when
turned out.

All cooked cheese is apt to be tasteless unless some of
the milk flavor cooked out is put back in, as wheat germ is now returned
to white bread. Almost every country has a cooked cheese all its own,
with or without caraway, such as the following:

Belgium—Kochtounkäse
Germany—Kochkäse, Topfen
Luxembourg—Kochenkäse
France—Fromage Ouit & Le P'Teux
Sardinia—Pannedas, Freisa

**Coon** *see* [Chapter
4](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_37).

**Cornhusker**
*U.S.A.*

A Nebraska product similar to Cheddar and Colby, but
with softer body and more moisture.

**Cornimont**
*Vosges, France*

A splendid French version of Alsatian Münster spiked
with caraway, in flattish cylinders with mahogany-red coating. It is
similar to Géromé and the harvest cheese of Gérardmer in the same lush
Vosges Valley.

**Corse, Roquefort de**
*Corsica, France*

Corsican imitation of the real Roquefort, and not
nearly so good, of course.

**Cossack**
*Caucasus*

Cow or sheep. There are two varieties: I. Soft, cured
in brine and still soft and mild after two months in
the salt bath.
II. Semihard and very sharp after aging in brine for a year or
more.

**Cotherstone**
*Yorkshire, England*

Also known as Yorkshire-Stilton, and Wensleydale No. I.
(*See both*.)

**Cotrone, Cotronese** *see* Pecorino.

**Cotta** *see* Pasta.

**Cottage cheese**

Made in all countries where any sort of milk is
obtainable. In America it's also called pot, Dutch, and smearcase. The
English, who like playful names for homely dishes, call cottage cheese
smearcase from the German Schmierkäse. It is also called Glumse in
Deutschland, and, together with cream, formed the basis of all of our
fine Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine.

**Cottenham or Double Cottenham**
*English Midlands*

Semihard; double cream; blue mold. Similar to Stilton
but creamier and richer, and made in flatter and broader forms.

**Cottslowe**
*Cotswold, England*

A brand of cream cheese named for its home in Cotswold,
Gloucester. Although soft, it tastes like hard Cheddar.

**Coulommiers Frais, or Petit-Moule**
*Ile-de-France, France*

Fresh cream similar to Petit Suisse. (*See*.)

**Coulommiers, le, or Brie de Coulommiers**
*France*

Also called Petit-moule, from its small form. This
genuine Brie is a pocket edition, no larger than a Camembert, standing
only one inch high and measuring five or six inches across. It is made
near Paris and is a great favorite from the autumn and winter months,
when it is made, on until May. The making starts in October, a month
earlier than most Brie, and it is off the market by July, so it's seldom
tasted by the avalanche of American summer tourists.

**Cow cheese**

Sounds redundant, and is used mostly in Germany, where
an identifying word is added, such as Berliner Kuhkäse and Alt Kuhkäse:
old cow cheese.

**Cream cheese**
*International*

England, France and America go for it heavily. English
cream begins with Devonshire, the world-famous, thick fresh cream that
is sold cool in earthenware pots and makes fresh berries—especially the
small wild strawberries of rural England—taste out of this world. It is
also drained on straw mats and formed into fresh hardened cheeses in
small molds. (*See* Devonshire cream.) Among regional specialties are
the following, named from their place of origin or commercial
brands:

* Cambridge
* Cottslowe
* Cornwall
* Farm Vale
* Guilford
* Homer's
* "Italian"
* Lincoln
* New Forest
* Rush (from being made on rush or straw mats—*see* Rush)
* St. Ivel (distinguished for being made with acidophilus bacteria)
* Scotch Caledonian
* Slipcote (famous in the eighteenth century)
* Victoria
* York

**Crème Chantilly** *see* Hablé.

**Crème de Gien** *see* Fromage.

Soft Gruyère cream cheese, arrives in America in
perfect condition in tin foil packets. Expensive but worth it.

**Crème des Vosges**
*Alsace, France*

Soft cream. Season October to April.

**Crème Double** *see* Double-Crème.

**Crème, Fromage à la** *see* Fromage.

**Crème, Fromage Blanc à la** *see* Fromage

**Crème St Gervais** *see* Pots de Crème St
Gervais.

**Crèmet Nantais**
*Lower Loire, France*

Soft fresh cream of Nantes.

**Crèmets, les**
*Anjou, France*

A fresh cream equal to English Devonshire, served more
as a dessert than a dessert cheese. The cream is whipped stiff with egg
whites, drained and eaten with more fresh cream, sprinkled with vanilla
and sugar.

**Cremini**
*Italy*

Soft, small cream cheese from Cremona, the violin town.
And by the way, art-loving Italians make ornamental cheeses in the form
of musical instruments, statues, still life groups and
everything.

**Creole**
*Louisiana, U.S.A.*

Soft, rich, unripened cottage cheese type, made by
mixing cottage-type curd and rich cream.

**Crescenza, Carsenza, Stracchino Crescenza, Crescenza
Lombardi**
*Lombardy, Italy*

Uncooked; soft; creamy; mildly sweet; fast-ripening;
yellowish; whole milk. Made from September to April.

**Creuse**
*Creuse, France*

A two-in-one farm cheese of skimmed milk, resulting
from two different ways of ripening, after the cheese has been removed
from perforated earthen molds seven inches in diameter and five or six
inches high, where it has drained for several days:
I. It is salted and turned frequently until very dry and hard.
II. It is ripened by placing in tightly closed mold, lined with straw.
This softens, flavors, and turns it golden-yellow. (*See* Hay
or Fromage de Foin.)

**Creusois, or Guéret**
*Limousin, France*

Season, October to June.

**Croissant Demi-sel**
*France*

Soft, double cream, semisalty. All year.

**Crottin de Chavignol**
*Berry, France*

Semihard; goat's milk; small; lightly salted; mellow.
In season April to December. The name is not exactly
complimentary.

**Crowdie, or Cruddy butter**
*Scotland*

Named from the combination of fresh sweet milk curds
pressed together with fresh butter. A popular breakfast food in
Inverness and the Ross Shires. When kept for months it develops a high
flavor. A similar curd and butter is made by Arabs and stored in vats,
the same as in India, the land of ghee, where there's no
refrigeration.

**Crying Kebbuck**

F. Marion MacNeill, in *The Scots Kitchen* says that
this was the name of a cheese that used to be part of the Kimmers feast
at a lying-in.

**Cuajada** *see* Venezuela.

**Cubjac** *see* Cajassou.

**Cuit** *see* Fromage Cuit.

**Cumin, Münster au** *see* Münster.

**Cup** *see* Koppen.

**Curd** *see* Granular curd, Sweet curd and York
curd.

**Curds and butter**
*Arabia*

Fresh sweet milk curd and fresh butter are pressed
together as in making Crowdie or Cruddy butter in Scotland. The Arabs
put this strong mixture away in vats to get it even stronger than East
Indian ghee.

**Curé, Fromage de** *see* Nantais.

### **D**

**Daisies, fresh**

A popular type and packaging of mild Cheddar,
originally English. Known as an "all-around cheese," to eat raw, cook,
let ripen, and use for seasoning.

**Dalmatian**
*Austria*

Hard ewe's-milker.

**Dambo**
*Denmark*

Semihard and nutty.

**Damen, or Glory of the Mountains (Gloires des
Montagnes)**
*Hungary*

Soft, uncured, mild ladies' cheese, as its name
asserts. Popular Alpine snack in Viennese cafés with coffee gossip in
the afternoon.

**Danish Blue**
*Denmark*

Semihard, rich, blue-veined, piquant, delicate,
excellent imitation of Roquefort. Sometimes called "Danish Roquefort,"
and because it is exported around the world it is Denmark's best-known
cheese. Although it sells for 20% to 30% less than the international
triumvirate of Blues, Roquefort, Stilton and Gorgonzola, it rivals them
and definitely leads lesser Blues.

**Danish Export**
*Denmark*

Skim milk and buttermilk. Round and flat, mild and
mellow. A fine cheese, as many Danish exports are.

**Dansk Schweizerost**
*Denmark*

Danish Swiss cheese, imitation Emmentaler, but with
small holes. Nutty, sweet dessert or "picnic cheese," as Swiss is often
called.

**Danzig**
*Poland*

A pleasant cheese to accompany a glass of the great
liqueur, Goldwasser, Eau de Vie de Danzig, from the same celebrated
city.

**Darling**
*U.S.A.*

One of the finest Vermont Cheddars, handled for years
by one of America's finest fancy food suppliers, S.S. Pierce of
Boston.

**Dauphin**
*Flanders, France*

Season, November to May.

**d'Aurigny, Fromage** *see* Alderney.

**Daventry**
*England*

A Stilton type, white, small, round, flat and very
rich, with "blue" veins of a darker green.

**Decize**
*Nivernaise, France*

In season all year. Soft, creamy, mellow, resembles
Brie.

**de Foin, Fromage** *see* Hay.

**de Fontine**
*Spain*

Crumbly, sharp, nutty.

**de Gascony, Fromage** *see* Castillon.

**de Gérardmer** *see* Récollet.

About the same as Leyden. (*See*.)

**Délicieux**

The brand name of a truly delicious Brie.

**Delikat**

A mellow breakfast spread, on the style of the German
Frühstück original. (*See*.)

**de Lile, Boule**

French name for Belgian Oude Kaas.

**Demi-Étuve**

Half-size Étuve. (*See*.)

**Demi Petit Suisse**

The name for an extra small Petit Suisse to distinguish
it from the Gros.

**Demi-Sel**
*Normandy, France*

Soft, whole, creamy, lightly salted, resembles Gournay
but slightly saltier; also like U.S. cream cheese, but softer and
creamier.

**Demi-Sel, Croissant** *see* Croissant
Demi-Sel.

**Derby, or Derbyshire**
*England*

Hard; shape like Austrian Nagelkassa and the size of
Cheshire though sometimes smaller. Dry, large, flat, round, flaky, sharp
and tangy. A factory cheese said to be identical with Double Gloucester
and similar to Warwickshire, Wiltshire and Leicester. The experts
pronounce it "a somewhat inferior Cheshire, but deficient in its quality
and the flavor of Cheddar." So it's unlikely to win in any cheese derby
in spite of its name.

**Devonshire cream and cheese**
*England*

Devonshire cream is world famous for its thickness and
richness. Superb with wild strawberries; almost a cream cheese by
itself. Devonshire cream is made into a luscious cheese ripened on
straw, which gives it a special flavor, such as that of French Foin or
Hay cheese.

**Dolce Verde**
*Italy*

This creamy blue-vein variety is named Sweet Green,
because cheesemongers are color-blind when it comes to the blue-greens
and the green-blues.

**Domaci Beli Sir**
*Yugoslavia*

"Sir" is not a title but the word for cheese. This is a
typical ewe's-milker cured in a fresh sheep skin.

**Domestic Gruyère**
*U.S.A.*

An imitation of a cheese impossible to imitate.

**Domestic Swiss**
*U.S.A*

Same as domestic Gruyère, maybe more so, since it is
made in ponderous 150-to 200-pound wheels, chiefly in Wisconsin and
Ohio. The trouble is there is no Alpine pasturage and Emmentaler Valley
in our country.

**Domiati**
*Egypt*

Whole or partly skimmed cow's or buffalo's milk. Soft;
white; no openings; mild and salty when fresh and cleanly acid when
cured. It's called "a pickled cheese" and is very popular in the Near
East.

**Dorset, Double Dorset, Blue Dorset, or Blue Vinny**
*England*

Blue mold type from Dorsetshire; crumbly, sharp; made
in flat forms. "Its manufacture has been traced back 150 years in the
family of F.E. Dare, who says that in all probability it was made longer
ago than that." (*See* Blue Vinny.)

**Dotter**
*Nürnberg, Germany*

An entirely original cheese perfected by G. Leuchs in
Nürnberg. He enriched skim milk with yolk of eggs and made the cheese in
the usual way. When well ripened it is splendid.

**Doubles**

The English name cheese made of whole milk "double,"
such as Double Cottenham, Double Dorset, Double Gloucester. "Singles"
are cheeses from which some of the cream has been removed.

**Double-cream**
*England*

Similar to Wensleydale.

**Double-crème**
*France*

There are several of this name, made in the summer when
milk is richest in cream. The full name is Fromage à la Double-crème,
and Pommel is one well known. They are made throughout France in season
and are much in demand.

**Dresdener Bierkäse**
*Germany*

A celebrated hand cheese made in Dresden. The typical
soft, skim milker, strong with caraway and drunk dissolved in beer, as
well as merely eaten.

**Drinking cheeses**

Not only Dresdener, but dozens of regional hand cheeses
in Germanic countries are melted in steins of beer or glasses of wine to
make distinctive cheesed drinks for strong stomachs and noses. This peps
up the drinks in somewhat the same way as ale and beer are laced with
pepper sauce in some parts.

**Dry**
*Germany*

From the drinking cheese just above to dry cheese is
quite a leap. "This cheese, known as Sperrkäse and Trockenkäse, is made
in the small dairies of the eastern part of the Bavarian Alps and in the
Tyrol. It is an extremely simple product, made for home consumption and
only in the winter season, when the milk cannot be profitably used for
other purposes. As soon as the milk is skimmed it is put into a large
kettle which can be swung over a fire, where it is kept warm until it is
thoroughly thickened from souring. It is then broken up and cooked quite
firm. A small quantity of salt and sometimes some caraway seed are
added, and the curd is put into forms of various sizes. It is then
placed in a drying room, where it becomes very hard, when it is ready
for eating." (From U.S. Department of Agriculture *Bulletin* No.
608.)

**Dubreala** *see* Brina.

**Duel**
*Austria*

Soft; skim milk; hand type; two by two by one-inch
cube.

**Dunlop**
*Scotland*

One of the national cheeses of Scotland, but now far
behind Cheddar, which it resembles, although it is closer in texture and
moister. Semihard; white; sharp; buttery; tangy and rich in flavor. It
is one of the "toasting cheeses" resembling Lancashire, too, in form and
weight. Made in Ayr, Lanark and Renfrew and sold in the markets of
Kilmarnock, Kirkcudbright and Wigtown.

**Durak**
*Turkey*

Mixed with butter; mellow and smoky. Costs three
dollars a pound.

**Duralag, or Bgug-Panir**
*Armenia*

Sheep; semisoft to brittle hard; square; sharp but
mellow and tangy with herbs. Sometimes salty from lying in a brine bath
from two days to two months.

**Durmar, Rarush** *see* Rarush.

**Dutch**
*Holland*

Cream cheese of skim milk, very perishable
spread.

**Dutch cheese**

American vernacular for cottage or pot cheese.

**Dutch Cream Cheese**
*England*

Made in England although called Dutch. Contains eggs,
and is therefore richer than Dutch cream cheese in Holland itself. In
America we call the original Holland-kind Dutch, cottage, pot, and
farmer.

**Dutch Mill**
*U.S.A.*

A specialty of Oakland, California.

**Dutch Red Balls**

English name for Edam.

### **E**

**Echourgnac, Trappe d'**
*Périgord, France*

Trappist monastery Port-Salut made in Limousin.

**Edam** *see* [Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).

**Egg**
*Finland*

Semihard. One of the few cheeses made by adding eggs to
the curds. Others are Dutch Cream Cheese of England; German Dotter;
French Fromage Cuit (cooked cheese), and Westphalian. Authorities agree
that these should be labeled "egg cheese" so the buyers won't be fooled
by their richness. The Finns age their eggs even as the Chinese ripen
their hundred-year-old eggs, by burying them in grain, as all
Scandinavians do, and the Scotch as well, in the oat bin. But none of
them is left a century to ripen, as eggs are said to be in China.

**Elbinger, or Elbing**
*West Prussia*

Hard; crumbly; sharp. Made of whole milk except in
winter when it is skimmed. Also known as Werderkäse and
Niederungskäse.

**Ekiwani**
*Caucasus*

Hard; sheep; white; sharp; salty with some of the brine
it's bathed in.

**Elisavetpolen, or Eriwani**
*Caucasus*

fresh from the brine bath. Also called Kasach (Cossack), Tali, Kurini
and Karab in different locales.

**Elmo Table**
*Italy*

Soft, mellow, tasty.

**Emiliano**
*Italy*

Hard; flavor varies from mild to sharp. Parmesan
type.

**Emmentaler**
*Switzerland*

There are so many, many types of this celebrated Swiss
all around the world that we're not surprised to find Lapland reindeer
milk cheese listed as similar to Emmentaler of the hardest variety.
(*See* [Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17),
*also* Vacherin Fondu.)

**"En enveloppe"**

French phrase of packaged cheese, "in the envelope."
Similar to English packet and our process. Raw natural cheese the French
refer to frankly as *nu*, "in the nude."

**Engadine**
*Graubünden, Switzerland*

Semihard; mild; tangy-sweet.

**English Dairy**
*England and U.S.A.*

Extra-hard, crumbly and sharp. Resembles Cheddar and
has long been imitated in the States, chiefly as a cooking
cheese.

**Entrechaux, le Cachat d'** *see* Cachat.

**Epoisses, Fromage d'**
*Côte d'Or, Upper Burgundy, France*

Soft, small cylinder with flattened end, about five
inches across. The season is from November to July. Equally proud of
their wine and cheese, the Burgundians marry white wine or *marc* to
d'Epoisses in making *confits* with that name.

**Erbo**
*Italy*

Similar to Gorgonzola. The Galvani cheesemakers of
Italy who put out both Bel Paese and Taleggio also export Erbo to our
shores.

**Erce**
*Languedoc, France*

Soft, smooth and sharp. A winter cheese in season only
from November to May.

**Eriwani** *see* Elisavetpolen.

**Ervy**
*Champagne, France*

two-and-a-half inches, weight four pounds. Resembles Camembert. A washed
cheese, also known as Fromage de Troyes. In season November to
May.

**Essex**
*U.S.A.*

Imitation of an extinct or at least dormant English
type.

**Estrella** *see* Serra da Estrella.

**Étuve and Demi-Étuve**
*Holland*

Semihard; smooth; mellow. In full size and demi (half)
size. In season all year.

**Evarglice**
*Yugoslavia*

Sharp, nutty flavor.

**Excelsior**
*Normandy, France*

Season all year.

### **F**

**Factory Cheddar**
*U.S.A.*

Very Old Factory Cheddar is the trade name for
well-aged sharp Cheddar. New Factory is just that—mild, young and
tractable—too tractable, in fact.

**Farm**
*France*

Known as Ferme; Maigre (thin); Fromage à la Pie
(nothing to do with apple pie); and Mou (weak). About the same as our
cottage cheese.

**Farmer**
*U.S.A.*

This is curd only and is nowadays mixed with pepper,
lachs, nuts, fruits, almost anything. A very good base for your own
fancy spread, or season a slab to fancy and bake it like a hoe cake, but
in the oven.

**Farmhouse** *see* Herrgårdsost.

**Farm Vale**
*England*

Cream cheese of Somerset wrapped in tin foil and boxed
in wedges, eight to a box.

**Fat cheese** *see* Frontage Gras and Maile
Pener.

**Fenouil** *see* Tome de Savoie.

**Ferme** *see* Farm.

**Feta** *see* [Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).

**Feuille de Dreux**
*Béarn, France*

November to May.

**"Filled cheese"**
*England*

Before our processed and food cheese era some
scoundrels in the cheese business over there added animal fats and
margarine to skimmed milk to make it pass as whole milk in making
cheese. Such adulteration killed the flavor and quality, and no doubt
some of the customers. Luckily in America we put down this vicious
counterfeiting with pure food laws. But such foreign fats are still
stuffed into the skimmed milk of many foreign cheeses. To take the place
of the natural butterfat the phony fats are whipped in violently and
extra rennet is added to speed up coagulation.

**Fin de Siècle**
*Normandy, France*

Although this is an "all year" cheese its name dates it
back to the years at the close of the nineteenth century.

**Fiore di Alpe**
*Italy*

Hard; sharp; tangy. Romantically named "Flowers of the
Alps."

**Fiore Sardo**
*Italy*

Ewe's milk. Hard. Table cheese when immature; a
condiment when fully cured.

*France*

A kind of Marolles.

**Fleur de Deauville**
*France*

A type of Brie, in season December to May.

**Fleur des Alpes** *see* Bel Paese and
Millefiori.

**Floedeost**
*Norway*

Like Gjedeost, but not so rich because it's made of
cow's milk.

**Fløtost**
*Norway*

Although the name translates Cream Cheese it is made of
boiled whey. Similar to Mysost, but fatter.

**Flower**
*England*

Soft and fragrant with petals of roses, violets,
marigolds and such, delicately mixed in. Since the English are so fond
of oriental teas scented with jasmine and other flowers, perhaps they
imported the idea of mixing petals with their cheese, since there is no
oriental cheese for them to import except bean curd.

**Fodder cheese**

A term for cheese made from fodder in seasons when
there is no grass. Good fresh grass is the essence of all fine cheese,
so silo or barn-fed cows can't give the kind of milk it takes.

**Foggiano**
*Apulia, Italy*

A member of the big Pecorino family because it's made
of sheep's milk.

**Foin, Fromage de** *see* Hay.

**Fondu, Vacherin** *see* Vacherin Fondu.

Hard; goat; similar to Swiss, but harder and sharper.
From the same region as Parmesan.

**Food cheese**
*U.S.A.*

An unattractive type of processed mixes, presumably
with some cheese content to flavor it.

**Forez, also called d'Ambert**
*France*

The process of making this is said to be very crude,
and the ripening unusual. The cheeses are cylindrical, ten inches in
diameter and six inches high. They are ripened by placing them on the
floor of the cellar, covering with dirt, and allowing water to trickle
over them. Many are spoiled by the unusual growths of mold and bacteria.
The flavor of the best of these is said to resemble Roquefort. (From
*Bulletin* No. 608 of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to which we
are indebted for descriptions of hundreds of varieties in this
alphabet.)

**Formagelle**
*Northwest Italy*

Soft, ripened specialty put up in half-pound
packages.

**Formaggi di Pasta Filata**
*Italy*

A group of Italian cheeses made by curdling milk with
rennet, warming and fermenting the curd, heating it until it is plastic,
drawing it into ropes and then kneading and shaping while hot.
Provolone, Caciocavallo and Mozzarella are in this group.

**Formaggini, and Formaggini di Lecco**
*Italy*

Several small cheeses answer to this name, of which
Lecco is typical. A Lombardy dessert cheese measuring 1¼ by two inches,
weighing two ounces. It is eaten from the time it is fresh and sweet
until it ripens to piquance. Sometimes made of cow and goat milk mixed,
with the addition of oil and vinegar, as well as salt, pepper, sugar and
cinnamon.

**Formaggio d'Oro**
*Northwest Italy*

Hard, sharp, mountain-made.

Auvergne, where many mountain varieties are baptized after their
districts, such as Aubrac, Aurilla, Grand Murol, Rôche and Salers.
(*See* Fourme d'Ambert and Cantal.)

**Fourme de Montebrison**
*Auvergne, France*

This belongs to the Fourme clan and is in season from
November to May.

**Fourme de Salers** *see* Cantal, which it resembles
so closely it is sometimes sold under that name.

**Fresa, or Pannedas**
*Sardinia, Italy*

A soft, mild and sweet cooked cheese.

**Fribourg**
*Italy and Switzerland*

Hard; cooked-curd, Swiss type very similar to Spalen.
(*See*)

**Frissche Kaas, Fresh cheese**
*Holland*

Dutch generic name for any soft, fresh spring cheese,
although some is made in winter, beginning in November.

**Friesian** *see* West Friesian.

**Fromage à la Creme**
*France*

I. Sour milk drained and mixed with cream. Eaten with
sugar. That of
Gien is a noted produce, and so is d'Isigny.
II. Franche-Comté—fresh sheep milk melted with fresh thick cream,
whipped egg whites and sugar.
III. Morvan—homemade cottage cheese. When milk has soured solid it is
hung in cheesecloth in a cool place to drain, then mixed with a
little fresh milk and served with cream.
IV. When Morvan or other type is put into a heart-shaped wicker basket
for a mold, and marketed in that, it becomes Coeur à la Crème,
heart of cream, to be eaten with sugar.

**Fromage à la Pie** *see* Fromage Blanc just below,
and Farm

**Fromage Bavarois à la Vanille**
*France*

Dessert cheese sweetened and flavored with vanilla and
named after Bavaria where it probably originated.

**Fromage Blanc**
*France*

Soft cream or cottage cheese, called à la Pie, too,
suggesting pie à la mode; also Farm from the place it's made. Usually
eaten with salt and pepper, in summer only. It is the ascetic version of
Fromage à la Crème, usually eaten with salt and pepper and without cream
or sugar, except in the Province of Bresse where it is served with cream
and called Fromage Blanc à la Crème.

Every milky province has its own Blanc. In Champagne
it's made of fresh ewe milk. In Upper Brittany it is named after Nantes
and also called Fromage de Curé. Other districts devoted to it are
Alsace-Lorraine, Auvergne, Languedoc, and Ile-de-France.

**Fromage Bleu** *see* Bleu d'Auvergne.

**Fromage Cuit (cooked cheese)**
*Thionville, Lorraine, France*

Although a specialty of Lorraine, this cooked cheese is
produced in many places. First it is made with fresh whole cow milk,
then pressed and potted. After maturing a while it is de-potted, mixed
with milk and egg yolk, re-cooked and re-potted.

**Fromage de Troyes**
*France*

Two cheeses have this name. (*See* Barberry and
Ervy.)

**Fromage de Vache**

Another name for Autun.

**Fromage de Monsieur Fromage**
*Normandy, France*

This Cheese of Mr. Cheese is as exceptional as its
name. Its season runs from November to June. It comes wrapped in a green
leaf, maybe from a grape vine, suggesting what to drink with it. It is
semidry, mildly snappy with a piquant pungence all its own. The playful
name suggests the celebrated dish, Poulette de Madame Poulet, Chick of
Mrs. Chicken.

**Fromage Fort**
*France*

Several cooked cheeses are named Fort (strong) chiefly
in the department of Aisne. Well-drained curd is melted, poured into a
cloth and pressed, then buried in dry ashes to remove any whey left.
After being fermented eight to ten days it is grated, mixed with butter,
salt, pepper, wine, juniper berries, butter and other things, before
fermenting some more.

Similar extra-strong cheeses are the one in Lorraine
called Fondue and Fromagère of eastern France, classed as the strongest
cheeses in all France.

*Fort No. I*: That of Flanders, potted with juniper
berries, as the gin of this section is flavored, plus pepper, salt and
white wine.

*Fort No. II*: That from Franche-Comté Small dry goat
cheeses pounded and potted with thyme, tarragon, leeks, pepper and
brandy. (*See* Hazebrook.)

*Fort No. III*: From Provence, also called Cachat
d'Entrechaux. In production from May to November. Semihard, sheep milk,
mixed with brandy, white wine, strong herbs and seasonings and well
marinated.

**Fromage Gras (fat cheese)**
*Savoy, France*

Soft, round, fat ball called *tête de mort*, "death's
head." Winter Brie is also called Gras but there is no relation. This
macabre name incited Victor Meusy to these lines:

*Les gens à l'humeur morose*

*Prennent la Tête-de-Mort*.

People of a morose disposition

Take the Death's Head.

**Fromage Mou**

Any soft cheese.

**Fromage Piquant** *see* Remoudon.

**Fromagère** *see* Canquillote.

**Fromages de Chèvre**

two-and-a-half to three inches in diameter. Limburger type. Cheeses on
which many Germans and Americans break their fast.

**Ftinoporino**
*Macedonia, Greece*

Sheep's-milker similar to Brinza.

### **G**

**Gaiskäsli**
*Germany and Switzerland*

A general name for goat's milk cheese. Usually a small
cylinder three inches in diameter and an inch-and-a-half thick, weighing
up to a half pound. In making, the curds are set on a straw mat in
molds, for the whey to run away. They are salted and turned after two
days to salt the other side. They ripen in three weeks with a very
pleasing flavor.

**Gammelost**
*Norway*

Hard, golden-brown, sour-milker. After being pressed it
is turned daily for fourteen days and then packed in a chest with wet
straw. So far as we are concerned it can stay there. The color all the
way through is tobacco-brown and the taste, too. It has been compared to
medicine, chewing tobacco, petrified Limburger, and worse. In his
*Encyclopedia of Food* Artemas Ward says that in Gammelost the ferments
absorb so much of the curd that "in consequence, instead of eating
cheese flavored by fungi, one is practically eating fungi flavored with
cheese."

**Garda**
*Italy*

Soft, creamy, fermented. A truly fine product made in
the resort town on Gardasee where d'Annunzio retired. It is one of those
luscious little ones exported in tin foil to America, and edible,
including the moldy crust that could hardly be called a rind.

**Garden**
*U.S.A.*

Cream cheese with some greens or vegetables mixed
in.

**Garlic**
*U.S.A.*

A processed Cheddar type flavored with garlic.

**Garlic-onion Link**

from October to April.

**Gervais**

**3/Dec/2004 15:38**
*Gloucestershire, England*

There are two types:
I. Double, the better of the two Gloucesters, is eaten only after six
months of ripening. "It has a pronounced, but mellow, delicacy of
flavor...the tiniest morsel being pregnant with savour. To measure
its refinement, it can undergo the same comparison as that we apply
to vintage wines. Begin with a small piece of Red Cheshire. If you
then pass to a morsel of Double Gloucester, you will find that the
praises accorded to the latter have been no whit exaggerated."
*A Concise Encyclopedia of Gastronomy,* by André L. Simon.
II. Single. By way of comparison, the spring and summer Single
Gloucester
ripens in two months and is not as big as its "large grindstone"
brother. And neither is it "glorified Cheshire." It is mild and
"as different in qualify of flavour as a young and crisp wine is
from an old vintage."

**Glumse**
*West Prussia, Germany*

A common, undistinguished cottage cheese.

**Glux**
*Nivernais, France*

Season, all year.

**Goat**
*France*

A frank and fair name for a semihard, brittle mouthful
of flavor. Every country has its goat specialties. In Norway the milk is
boiled dry, then fresh milk or cream added. In Czechoslovakia the
peasants smoke the cheese up the kitchen chimney. No matter how you
slice it, goat cheese is always notable or noble.

**Gold-N-Rich**
*U.S.A.*

Golden in color and rich in taste. Bland, as American
taste demands. Like Bel Paese but not so full-flavored and a bit sweet.
A good and deservedly popular cheese none the less, easily recognized by
its red rind.

**Gomost**
*Norway*

Usually made from cow's milk, but sometimes from
goat's. Milk is curdled with rennet and condensed by heating until it
has a butter-like consistency. (*See* Mysost.)

**Gorgonzola**
*Italy*

Besides the standard type exported to us (*See* [Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).)
there is White Gorgonzola, little known outside Italy where it is
enjoyed by local caseophiles, who like it put up in crocks with brandy,
too.

**Gouda** *see* [Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).

**Gouda, Kosher**
*Holland*

The same semihard good Gouda, but made with kosher
rennet. It is a bit more mellow than most and, like all kosher products,
is stamped by the Jewish authorities who prepare it.

**Goya**
*Corrientes, Argentine*

Hard, dry, Italian type for grating. Like all fine
Argentine cheeses the milk of pedigreed herds fed on prime pampas grass
distinguishes Goya from lesser Parmesan types, even back in
Italy.

It is interesting that the nitrate in Chilean soil
makes their wines the best in America, and the richness of Argentine
milk does the same for their cheeses, most of which are Italian
imitations and some of which excel the originals.

**Gournay**
*Seine, France*

Soft, similar to Demi-sel, comes in round and flat
forms about ¼ pound in weight. Those shaped like Bondons resemble corks
about ¾ of an inch thick and four inches long.

**Grana**
*Italy*

Another name for Parmesan. From "grains", the size of
big shot, that the curd is cut into.

**Grana Lombardo**
*Lombardy*

The same hard type for grating, named after its origin
in Lombardy.

**Grana Reggiano**
*Reggio, Italy*

A brand of Parmesan type made near Reggio and widely
imitated, not only in Lombardy and Mantua, but also in the Argentine
where it goes by a pet name of its own—Regianito.

**Grande Bornand, la**
*Switzerland*

A luscious half-dried sheep's milker.

**Granular curd** *see* Stirred curd.

**Gras, or Velvet Kaas**
*Holland*

Named from its butterfat content and called "Moors
Head", *Tête de Maure*, in France, from its shape and size. The same is
true of Fromage de Gras in France, called *Tête de Mort*, "Death's
Head". Gras is also the popular name for Brie that's made in the autumn
in France and sold from November to May. (*See* Brie.)

**Gratairon**
*France*

Goat milk named, as so many are, from the place it is
made.

**Graubünden**

in brine bath. Named from the gray color that pervades the entire cheese
when ripe. It has a very pleasant taste.

**Gruyère** *see* [Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).

Soft ripened dessert cheese made from pasteurized cream
by the old Walla Creamery. Put up in five-ounce wedge-shaped boxes for
export and sold for a high price, well over two dollars a pound, in
fancy big city groceries. Truly an aristocrat of cheeses to compare with
the finest French Brie or Camembert. *See* [Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).

**Hand** *see* [Chapter

*Harz Mountains, Germany*

juniper, salt and
pepper. Excessively strong for bland American tasters.

marinated in a mixture of thyme, tarragon, leeks, pepper and
brandy.

Four cheeses are called Head:

head and is only a cheese by discourtesy.

A strong variety of Gjetost, little known and less
liked outside of Scandinavia.

### **I**

**Icelandic**

In *Letters from Iceland*, W.H. Auden says: "The

Semihard "Cheese of the Isle," largely exported to

imitations named after their native places of manufacture: Ardagh,
Galtee, Whitehorn, Three Counties, etc.

**Isigny**
*France*

Full name Fromage à la Crème d'Isigny. *(See.)* Cream
cheese. The American cheese of this name never amounted to much. It was
an attempt to imitate Camembert in the Gay Nineties, but it turned out
to be closer to Limburger. (*See* [Chapter
2](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_11).)

In France there is also Crème d'Isigny, thick fresh
cream that's as famous as England's Devonshire and comes as close to
being cheese as any cream can.

**Island of Orléans**
*Canada*

This soft, full-flavored cheese was doubtless brought
from France by early emigrés, for it has been made since 1869 on the
Orléans Island in the St. Lawrence River near Quebec. It is known by its

name "refined."

### **J**

day.

**La Foncée, or Fromage de Pau**

here.

the Roman occupation. Many consider Laguiole superior to Cantal. It is

you can get it. It is more like Cheshire than Cheddar. This most popular
variety in the north of England is turned out best at Fylde, near the
Irish Sea. It is a curiosity in manufacture, for often the curds used
are of different ages, and this is accountable for a loose, friable
texture. Deep orange in color.

to eight pounds.

**Leaf** *see* Tschil.

**Leather, Leder, or Holstein Dairy**
*Germany*

A skim-milker with five to ten percent buttermilk, all
from the great *milch* cows up near Denmark in Schleswig-Holstein. A
technical point in its making is that it's "broken up with a harp or a
stirring stick and stirred with a Danish stirrer."

**Lebanie**
*Syria*

Dessert cottage cheese often served with yogurt.

**Lecco, Formaggini di**
*Italy*

Soft; cow or goat; round dessert variety;

Italians.

**Lees** *see* Appenzeller, Festive, No. II.

**LeGuéyin**

Half-dried; small; salted; peppered and sharp. The salt
*and* pepper make it unusual, though not as peppery as Italian
Pepato.

**Leicester**
*England*

Hard; shallow; flat millstone of Cheddar-like cheese
weighing forty pounds. Dark orange and mild to red and strong, according
to age. With Wiltshire and Warwickshire it belongs to the Derbyshire

A kind of Pecorino.

Notable because it's a natural cheese in a mob of
modern processed.

**Lerroux**
*France*

Goat; in season from February to September and not
eaten in fall or winter months.

**Lescin**
*Caucasus*

Curious because the sheep's milk that makes it is
milked directly into a sack of skin. It is made in the usual way, rennet
added, curd broken up, whey drained off, curd put into forms and pressed
lightly. But after that it is wrapped in leaves and ropes of grass.
After curing two weeks in the leaves, they are discarded, the cheese
salted and wrapped up in leaves again for another ripening
period.

The use of a skin sack again points the association of
cheese and wine in a region where wine is still drunk from skin bags
with nozzles, as in many wild and mountainous parts.

**Les Petits Bressans**
*Bresse, France*

Small goat cheeses named from food-famous Bresse, of
the plump pullets, and often stimulated with brandy before being wrapped

4](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_37).

3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).

**Lincoln**
*England*

Cream cheese that keeps two to three weeks. This is in
England, where there is much less refrigeration than in the U.S.A., and
that's a big break for most natural cheeses.

**Lindenhof**
*Belgium*

Semisoft; aromatic; sharp.

**Lipta, Liptauer, Liptoiu**
*Hungary*

A classic mixture with condiments, especially the great
peppers from which the world's best paprika is made. Liptauer is the
regional name for Brinza, as well, and it's made in the same manner, of
sheep milk and sometimes cow. Salty and spready, somewhat oily, as most
sheep-milkers are. A fairly sharp taste with a suggestion of sour milk.
It is sold in various containers and known as "pickled cheese." (*See*
[Chapter
3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_17).)

relative of both Liptauer and Brinza.

**Little Nippy**
*U.S.A.*

Processed cheese with a cute name, wrapped up both
plain and smoky, to "slice and serve for cheese trays, mash or whip for
spreading," but no matter how you slice, mash and whip it, it's still
processed.

**Livarot**
*Calvados, France*

Soft paste, colored with annatto-brown or deep red
(also, uncommonly, fresh and white). It has the advantage over
Camembert, made in the same region, in that it may be manufactured
during the summer months when skim milk is plentiful and cheap. It is
formed in cylinders, six by two inches, and ripened several months in
the even temperature of caves, to be eaten at its best only in January,
February and March. By June and afterward it should be avoided. Similar
to Mignot II. Early in the process of making, after ripening ten to
twelve days, the cheeses are wrapped in fresh *laiche* leaves, both to
give flavor and help hold in the ammonia and other essentials for making
a strong, piquant Livarot.

**Livlander**
*Russia*

with pistachio nuts besides salt and pepper. Eaten while quite young, in
two-ounce portions that bring a very high price.

aromatic, with a character of its own.

would-be Camembert.

*German*

Typical hand cheese, kneaded by hand thoroughly, which
makes for quality, pressed into flat cakes by hand, dried for a week,
packed in kegs or jars and ripened in the cellar six to eight weeks. As
in making bread, the skill in kneading Mainzer makes a worthy
craft.

**Majocchino**

kind of Incanestrato.

is unusual for any Italian cheese.

Sheep or cow's milk heated to boiling, then cooled
"until the fingers can be held in it". A mixture of fresh whey and

related to the Münster tribe, with very distant connections with the
mildest branch of the Limburgers.

The Schachtelkäse is named from the wooden boxes in
which it is shipped, while the Schlosskäse shows its class by being
called Castle Cheese, probably because it is richer than the others,
being made of whole milk.

**Money made of cheese**
*China*

In the Chase National Bank collection of moneys of the
world there is a specimen of "Cheese money" about which the curator,
Farran Zerbee, writes: "A specimen of the so-called 'cheese money' of
Northern China, 1850-70, now in the Chase Bank collection, came to me
personally some thirty years ago from a woman missionary, who had been
located in the field where she said a cake form of condensed milk, and
referred to as 'cheese,' was a medium of exchange among the natives. It,
like other commodities, particularly compressed tea, was prized as a
trading medium in China, in that it had value as nutriment and was
sufficiently appreciated by the population as to be exchangeable for
other articles of service."

**Mother's milk**

Maurice des Ombiaux sums up the many exotic milks made into cheese and
recounts the story of Paul Bert, who served a cheese "white as snow"
that was so delicately appetizing it was partaken of in "religious
silence." All the guests guessed, but none was right. So the host
announced it was made of *"lait de femme"* and an astounded turophile
exclaimed, "Then all of us are cannibals."

**Mozzarella**
*Italy*

bland, white cooking cheese put up in balls or big bowl-like cups
weighing about a half pound and protected with wax paper. The genuine is
made at Cardito, Aversa, Salernitano and in the Mazzoni di Capua. Like
Ricotta, this is such a popular cheese all over America that it is
imitated widely, and often badly, with a bitter taste.

*Italy*

Semisoft; smooth; white; bland; un-salted. Put up in
pear shapes of about one pound, with tan rind, from smoking.

Semihard; whole milk; yellow inside, brick-red outside; flavor from mild
to strong, depending on age and amount of caraway or anise seed added.
Best in winter season, from November to April.

Münster is a world-wide classic that doubles for both
German and French. Géromé is a standard French type of it, with a little
longer season, beginning in April, and a somewhat different flavor from
anise seed. Often, instead of putting the seeds inside, a dish of
caraway is served with the cheese for those who like to flavor to
taste.

In Alsace, Münster is made plain and also under the
name of Münster au Cumin because of the caraway.

American imitations are much milder and marketed much
younger. They are supposed to blend the taste of Brick and Limburger;
maybe they do.

from lush mountain-grazing.

**Notruschki (cheese bread)**
*Russia*

Made with Tworog cheese and widely popular.

**Nova Scotia Smoked**
*U.S.A.*

The name must mean that the cheese was smoked in the
Nova Scotia manner, for it is smoked mostly in New York City, like
sturgeon, to give the luxurious flavor.

**Nuworld**
*U.S.A.*

This semisoft newcomer arrived about 1954 and is
advertised as a brand-new variety. It is made in the Midwest and packed

entirely new species or not.

Hard, mountain-sheep cheese of quality Cellar-ripened
three months. Weight six to ten pounds.

**Oxfordshire**

An obsolescent type, now only of literary interest
because of Jonathan Swift's little story around it, in the eighteenth
century:

"An odd land of fellow, who when the cheese came upon
the table, pretended to faint; so somebody said, Pray take away the
cheese.'

"'No,' said I, 'pray take away the fool. Said I
well?'

"To this Colonel Arwit rejoins: 'Faith, my lord, you
served the coxcomb right enough; and therefore I wish we had a bit of
your lordship's Oxfordshire cheese.'"

### **P**

**Pabstett**
*U.S.A*

The Pabst beer people got this out during Prohibition,
and although beer and cheese are brothers under their ferment, and
Prohibition has long since been done away with, the relation of the
processed paste to a natural cheese is still as distant as near beer
from regular beer.

This corresponds to our process cheese and is named
from the package or packet it comes in.

interest because in Switzerland, the motherland of cheese, it is an
imitation of a foreign type.

veining.

**Parmesan, Parmigiano**
*Italy*

The grand mogul of all graters. Called "The hardest
cheese in the world." It enlivens every course from onion soup to cheese
straws with the demitasse, and puts spirit into the sparse Lenten menu
as *Pasta al Pesto*, powdered Parmesan, garlic, olive oil and basil,
pounded in a mortar with a pestle.

**Passauer Rahmkäse, Crème de Passau**
*German*

Noted Bavarian cream cheese, known in France as Crème
de Passau.

grains into which Grana is chopped.(*See* Formaggi di Pasta
Filata.)

**Pasteurized Process Cheese Food**

This is the ultimate desecration of natural fermented
cheese. Had Pasteur but known what eventual harm his discovery would do
to a world of cheese, he might have stayed his hand.

Soft, rich table cheese.

**Patagras**

**Penicillium Glaucum and Penicillium Album**

Tiny mushroom spores of *Penicillium Glaucum* sprinkled

second spore develops on the surface, snow-white*Penicillium
Album*.

Mellow sheep cheese packed in the skin of sheep or
lamb.

*U.S.A.*

This German original has been made by the Pennsylvania

**Penroque**
*Pennsylvania, U.S.A*

Cow milk imitation Roquefort, inoculated with
*Penicillium Roqueforti* and ripened in "caverns where nature has
duplicated the ideal condition of the cheese-curing caverns of France."
So any failure of Penroque to rival real Roquefort is more likely to be
the fault of mother cow than mother nature.

**Pepato**
*Italy*

Hard; stinging, with whole black peppers that make the
lips burn. Fine for fire-eaters.

An American imitation is made in Northern
Michigan.

**Persillé de Savoie**

a manner similar to that of sage in Vermont Cheddar.

*Denmark*

Imitation Gruyère, pasteurized, processed and made
almost unrecognizable and inedible. Six tin-foil wedges to a box; also
packaged with a couple of crackers for bars, one wedge for fifteen
cents, where free lunch is forbidden. This is a fair sample of one of
several foreign imitations that are actually worse than we can do at
home.

**Petit Moule**
*Ile-de-France, France*

A pet name for Coulommiers.

**Petit Suisse**
*France*

Fresh, unsalted cream cheese. The same as Neufchâtel
and similar to Coulommiers. It comes in two sizes:
Gros—a largest cylinder

Keats called this "the creamy curd," and another writer
has praised its "La Fontaine-like simplicity." Whether made in Normandy,
Switzerland, or Petropolis, Brazil, by early Swiss settlers, it is ideal
with honey.

**Petit Vacher**
*France*

"Little Cowboy," an appropriate name for a small
cow's-milk cheese.

**Petits Bourgognes**

In season from May to December.

**Pie, Fromage à la**
*France*

Another name for Fromage Blanc or Farm; soft, creamy
cottage-cheese type.

**Pie Cheese**
*U.S.A*

An apt American name for any round store cheese that
can be cut in wedges like a pie. Perfect with apple or mince or any
other pie. And by the way, in these days when natural cheese is getting
harder to find, any piece of American Cheddar cut in pie wedges before
being wrapped in cellophane is apt to be the real thing—if it has the
rind on. The wedge shape is used, however, *without any rind*, to make
processed pastes pass for "natural" even without that identifying word,
and with misleading labels such as old, sharp Cheddar and "aged nine
months." That's long enough to make a baby, but not a "natural" out of a
processed "Cheddar."

**Pimiento**
*U.S.A.*

Because pimiento is the blandest of peppers, it just
suits our bland national taste, especially when mixed with Neufchâtel,
cream, club or cottage. The best is homemade, of course, with honest,
snappy old Cheddar mashed and mixed to taste, with the mild Spanish
pepper that equals the Spanish olive as a partner in such
spreads.

pseudo-sausage links.

**Pot cheese**
*U.S.A.*

Cottage cheese with a dry curd, not creamed. An old
English favorite for fruited cheese cakes with perfumed plums, lemons,
almonds and macaroons. In Ireland it was used in connection with the
sheep-shearing ceremonies, although itself a common cow curd.
Pennsylvania pot cheese is cooked.

**Potato**
*Germany and U.S.A.*

Made in Thuringia from sour cow milk with sheep or goat
sometimes added. "The potatoes are boiled and grated or mashed. One part
of the potato is thoroughly mixed or kneaded with two or three parts of
die curd. In the better cheese three parts of potatoes are mixed with
two of curd. During the mixing, salt and sometimes caraway seed are
added. The cheese is allowed to stand for from two to four days while a
fermentation takes place. After this the curd is sometimes covered with
beer or cream and is finally placed in tubs and allowed to ripen for
fourteen days. A variety of this cheese is made in the U.S. It is
probable, however, that it is not allowed to ripen for quite so long a
period as the potato cheese of Europe. In all other essentials it
appears to be the same." From U.S. Department of Agriculture *Bulletin*
No. 608.

**Potato Pepper**

known and appreciated cheese. It is almost as widely but badly imitated
in the U.S.A., where the final "e" and "i" are interchangeable.

Cured in string nets that stay on permanently to hang
decoratively in the home kitchen or dining room. Like straw Chianti
bottles, Provolones weigh from *bocconi* (mouthful), about one pound, to
two to four pounds. There are three-to five-pound Provoletti, and upward
with huge Salamis and Giants. Small ones come ball, pear, apple, and all
sorts of decorative shapes, big ones become monumental sculptures that

**Rush Cream Cheese**
*England and France*

Not named from the rush in which many of our cheeses
are made, but from the rush mats and nets some fresh cream cheeses are
wrapped and sewed up in to ripen. According to an old English recipe the
curds are collected with an ordinary fish-slice and placed in a rush
shape, covered with a cloth when filled. Lay a half-pound weight in a
saucer and set this on top of the strained curd for a few hours, and
then increase the weight by about a half pound. Change the cloths daily
until the cheese looks mellow, then put into the rush shape with the
fish slice. The formula in use in France, where willow heart-shape
baskets are sold for making this cheese, is as follows: Add one cup new
warm milk to two cups freshly-skimmed cream. Dissolve in this one
teaspoon of fine sugar and one tablespoon common rennet or thirty drops
of Hauser's extract of rennet. Let it remain in a warm place until curd
sets. Rush and straw mats are easily made by cutting the straw into
lengths and stringing them with a needle and thread. The mats or baskets
should not be used a second time.

known as Hartkäse, Reibkäse and Walliskäse, it came to fame in the
sixteenth century and has always fetched an extra price for its quality
and age. It is cooked much dryer in the making, so it takes longer to

pounds and the eyes are small and scarce. The average period needed for
ripening is six years, but some take nine.

**Sage, or Green cheese**
*England*

This is more of a cream cheese, than a Cheddar, as Sage
is in the U.S.A. It is made by adding sage leaves and a greening to milk
by the method described in [Chapter
4](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14293/14293-h/14293-h.htm#Page_37).

**Saint-Affrique**
*Guyenne, France*

This gourmetic center, hard by the celebrated town of

and next to Stilton. Also called Jura Bleu, and a member of the triple
milk triplets with Gex and Sassenage.

**Serbian**
*Serbia*

Made most primitively by dropping heated stones into a
kettle of milk over an open fire. After the rennet is added, the curd
stands for an hour and is separated from the whey by being lifted in a
cheesecloth and strained. It is finally put in a wooden vessel to ripen.

(see Schlesischer.)

**Sir cheeses**

In Yugoslavia, Montenegro and adjacent lands Sir or Cyr
means cheese. Mostly this type is made of skimmed sheep milk and has
small eyes or holes, a sharp taste and resemblance to both American
Brick and Limburger. They are much fewer than the Saint cheeses in
France.

**Sir Iz Mjesine**
*Dalmatia, Yugoslavia*

Primitively made by heating skim sheep milk in a bottle
over an open fire, coagulating it quickly with pig or calf rennet,
breaking up the curd with a wooden spoon and stirring it by hand over
the fire. Pressed into forms eight inches square and two inches thick,
it is dried for a day and either eaten fresh or cut into cubes, salted,
packed in green sheep or goat hides, and put away to ripen.

*Serbia*

Semisoft; whole milk. Mellow.

**Skyr**
*Iceland*

The one standard cheese of the country. A cross between
Devonshire cream and cream cheese, eaten with sugar and cream. It is
very well liked and filling, so people are apt to take too much. A
writer on the subject gives this bit of useful information for
travelers: "It is not advisable, however, to take coffee and Skyr
together just before riding, as it gives you diarrhea."

**Slipcote, or Colwick**
*England*

Soft; unripened; small; white; rich as butter. The curd
is put in forms six by two inches for the whey to drain away. When firm
it is placed between cabbage leaves to ripen for a week or two, and when
it is taken from the leaves the skin or coat becomes loose and easily
slips off—hence the name. In the middle of the eighteenth century it was
considered the best cream cheese in England and was made then, as today,
in Wissenden, Rutlandshire.

Because this cheese is made of vegetable milk and often
developed with a vegetable rennet, it is rated by many as a regular
cheese. But our occidental kind with animal milk and rennet is never
eaten by Chinese and the mere mention of it has been known to make them
shiver.

*Switzerland*

A small Emmentaler of fine reputation made in the
Canton of Unterwalden from whole and partly skimmed milk and named from
the vessel in which five or six are packed and transported
together.

**Sperrkäse** *see* Dry.

**Spiced**
*International*

Many a bland cheese is saved from oblivion by the
addition of spice, to give it zest. One or more spices are added in the
making and thoroughly mixed with the finished product, so the cheese
often takes the name of the spice: Kuminost or Kommenost for cumin;
Caraway in English and several other languages, among them Kümmel,
Nokkelost and Leyden; Friesan Clove and Nagelkass; Sage; Thyme,
cloverleaf Sapsago; whole black pepper Pepato, etc.

**Suffolk**
*England*

"flet milk" cartwheels locally nicknamed "bang." Never popular anywhere,
it has stood more abuse than Limburger, not for its smell but for its
flinty hardness.

"Hunger will break through stone walls and
anything

except a Suffolk cheese."

A national pride, named for its country, Swedish
cheese, to match Swiss cheese and Dutch cheese. It comes in three
qualities: full cream, ¾ cream, and half cream. Soft; rich; ready to eat
at six weeks and won't keep past six months. A whole-hearted,
whole-milk, wholesome cheese named after the country rather than a part
of it as most *osts* are.

**Sweet-curd**
*U.S.A.*

Hard Cheddar, differing in that the milk is set sweet
and the curd cooked firmer and faster, salted and pressed at once. When
ripe, however, it is hardly distinguishable from the usual Cheddar made
by the granular process.

**Swiss**
*U.S.A.*

In 1845 emigrants from Galrus, Switzerland, founded New
Galrus, Wisconsin and, after failing at farming due to cinch bugs
gobbling their crops, they turned to cheesemaking and have been at it
ever since. American Swiss, known long ago as picnic cheese, has been
their standby, and only in recent years these Wisconsin Schweizers have
had competition from Ohio and other states who turn out the typical
cartwheels, which still look like the genuine imported
Emmentaler.

**Szekely**
*Transylvania, Hungary*

Soft; sheep; packed in links of bladders and sometimes
smoked. This is the type of foreign cheese that set the popular style

Limburger type.

**Tao-foo or Tofu**
*China, Japan, the Orient*

Soybean curd or cheese made from the "milk" of
soybeans. The beans are ground and steeped, made into a paste that's
boiled so the starch dissolves with the casein. After being strained
off, the "milk" is coagulated with a solution of gypsum. This is then
handled in the same way as animal milk in making ordinary cow-milk
cheeses. After being salted and pressed in molds it is ready to be
warmed up and added to soups and cooked dishes, as well as being eaten
as is.

**Teleme**

*Tibet*

The small, hard, grating cheeses named after the
country Tibet, are of sheep's milk, in cubes about two inches on all

**Tilsit, or Tilsiter Käse, also called Ragnit**
*Germany*

This classical variety of East Prussia is similar to
American Brick. Made of whole milk, with many small holes that give it
an open texture, as in Port-Salut, which it also resembles, although it
is stronger and coarser.

Old Tilsiter is something special in aromatic tang, and
attempts to imitate it are made around the world. One of them, Ovár, is
such a good copy it is called Hungarian Tilsit. There are American,
Danish, and Canadian—even Swiss—imitations.

The genuine Tilsit has been well described as
"forthright in flavor; a good snack cheese, but not suitable for elegant
post-prandial dallying."

rind, soft interior like Brie or Camembert; round, five to six by twelve
inches in diameter. Made in summer to eat in winter. When fully ripe it
is almost a cold version of the great dish called Fondue. Inside the

Brie, so it can be eaten with a spoon, dunked in, or spread on bread.
The local name is Tome de Montague.

II. Vacherin Fondu, or Spiced Fondu. Switzerland.
Although called Fondu from being melted, the No. I Vacherin comes much
closer to our conception of the dish Fondue, which we spell with an
"e."

Vacherin No. II might be called a re-cooked and spiced
Emmentaler, for the original cheese is made, and ripened about the same
as the Swiss classic and is afterward melted, spiced and reformed into
Vacherin.

**Welsh cheeses**

The words Welsh and cheese have become synonyms down
the ages. Welsh "cheeses can be attractive: the pale, mild Caerphilly
was famous at one time, and nowadays has usually a factory flavor. A
soft cream cheese can be obtained at some farms, and sometimes holds the
same delicate melting sensuousness that is found in the poems of John
Keats.

"The 'Resurrection Cheese' of Llanfihangel Abercowyn is
no longer available, at least under that name. This cheese was so called
because it was pressed by gravestones taken from an old church that had
fallen into ruins. Often enough the cheeses would be inscribed with such
wording as 'Here lies Blodwen Evans, aged 72.'" (From *My Wales* by Rhys
Davies.)

**Wensleydale**
*England*

I. England, Yorkshire. Hard; blue-veined; double cream;
similar to
Stilton. This production of the medieval town of Wensleydale in the Ure
Valley is also called Yorkshire-Stilton and is in season from June to
September. It is put up in the same cylindrical form as Stilton, but
smaller. The rind is corrugated from the way the wrapping is put
on.

II. White; flat-shaped; eaten fresh; made mostly from
January through the Spring, skipping the season when the greater No. I
is made (throughout the summer) and beginning to be made again in the
fall and winter.

**Westphalia Sour Milk, or Brioler**
*Germany*

Sour-milk hand cheese, kneaded by hand. Butter and/or
egg yolk is mixed in with salt, and either pepper or caraway seeds. Then
the richly colored curd is shaped by hand into small balls or rolls of
about one pound. It is dried for a couple of hours before being put down
cellar to ripen. The peculiar flavor is due partly to the seasonings and
partly to the curd being allowed to putrify a little, like Limburger,
before pressing.

This sour-milker is as celebrated as Westphalian raw
ham. It is so soft and fat it makes a sumptuous spread, similar to
Tilsit and Brinza. It was named Brioler from the "Gute Brioler" inn
where it was perfected by the owner, Frau Westphal, well over a century
ago.

The English sometimes miscall it Bristol from a
Hobson-Jobson of the name Briol.

**Whale Cheese**
*U.S.A.*

In *The Cheddar Box,* Dean Collins tells of an ancient

after milking the whales.

Swiss.

**Withania**
*India*

Cow taboos affect the cheesemaking in India, and in
place of rennet from calves a vegetable rennet is made from withania
berries. This names a cheese of agreeable flavor when ripened, but,
unfortunately, it becomes acrid with age.

### **Y**

**Yorkshire-Stilton**

hung.

Cheddars.
