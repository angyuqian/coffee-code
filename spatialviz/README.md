# Basics of Spatial Visualization [View or download slides]

This workshop will introduce participants to basic terms, different map types, data formats, use cases, and visualization tools. Through hands-on exercises participants will deconstruct a map project to see how it was made and think about how a visualization might be used in pedagogy or research.

# Exercise 1
In this exercise you will select one project listed below and answer several questions.

- Alexander, Madi. [Oklahoma Earthquakes](http://madialexander.carto.com/viz/79d46fd8-f70f-11e3-93da-0e73339ffa50/public_map)
- Esri. [Males and Females without health insurance in the United States](https://arcg.is/LajuL) 
- Kijas, Anna. [IMLS Discretionary Grant Funding 1996-2014](https://public.tableau.com/views/IMLSDiscretionaryGrantFunding1996-2014/IMLSGrants1996-2014)
- Knightlab. [Arya’s Journey](https://storymap.knightlab.com/examples/aryas-journey/)
- MIT Seseable City Lab. [Treepedia](http://senseable.mit.edu/treepedia/cities/boston) 

## Questions to Consider

- What type of map is it? 
- What is the underlying data source.
- What goal or research question does this map addresses? Is it clear?
- Is it interactive, if so, how?
- How was the map created? Do you know which software, tools, methods, etc. were used?
- Is it user-friendly? If not, why and what would you improve?
- Any other observations?


# Exercise 2

Consider your own research or pedagogical needs. What type of question(s) or arguments can you make with a spatial visualization? Reflect on these and other questions while drawing or sketching out a dataset, map, or other visualization.

- What type of map would help you answer this question?
- How could you use spatial visualization in a class setting?
- What type of data source(s) would you need? 
- Would you create your own data or require an existing dataset?
- What kind of resources might you need access to?
